We want to take this opportunity to thank them for resolving potential issues in a quick and orderly manner. We would also like to thank the STIP & STIP Bridge multi-sig committees for their invaluable assistance in navigating subjective areas pertaining to whether certain actions should be (or not be) deemed as misuse of funds.Unfortunately, there is only a single project that failed to return funds to the DAO. We are left with no choice but to publicly share this information with the DAO:Furucombo (cc: @Blazar):Furucombo has not published a final STIP report.It appears they sent the 59.5K ARB from the STIP to Kraken accounts, making it unclear how incentives were spent.Additionally, the project froze incentives towards ‘wash traders’, with users claiming they received significantly fewer rewards than expected.Furucombo have notified us (and StableLabs) that the funds will be returned. However, after subsequent requests from us, the funds still remain in their possession.What are the next steps?Furucombo will have 1 week to present their case to the ArbitrumDAO as a reply on this thread.If the project’s explanation is not to the Arbitrum Foundation’s satisfaction, and the funds (~59.5k ARB) are not returned within the same week, the Arbitrum Foundation will seek a vote from the ArbitrumDAO on the following:Should Furucombo, including all founders, current team members, and affiliated contributors, be permanently banned from all future ArbitrumDAO programs?There is also an option, assuming Furucombo is banned from the ArbitrumDAO, for the Arbitrum Foundation to further enforce the grant agreement signed with Furucombo and seek legal recourse to return the funds.Lessons LearnedThe DAO is still young, and it is natural for it to learn with time and experience. Based on the incentive programs to date, here are some lessons that the Arbitrum Foundation have observed, that can hopefully be taken forward into future programs:Going forward, STIP rules should be more clearly defined on deadlines in which an incentive grant should be claimed by users and remaining funds to the ArbitrumDAO.Funds should be distributed from addresses that are solely used for incentive programs and projects should avoid commingled of funds. Put another way, it should be very straightforward to follow via on-chain transactions how the incentives are distributed.An incentive program should specify an authority, or a group of people, who are responsible for interpretation of the rules of the incentive program and whether a project has misused funds. To date, this responsibility has fallen on the appointed multisig, and the exact powers are not clear.All projects must be encouraged and required to report any change to their incentive program to the ArbitrumDAO. If there is a material change, it should require approval from an appropriate authority for the incentive program.On-chain analytic companies should be hired to help track the distribution of incentives in real-time. It may be wise to introduce tranches as opposed to simply streaming and further funds are only released if the protocol has carried out the will of their proposal.For more information on the STIP Program, check out these resources:STIP RulesSTIP Proposal on Tally"

This report is a bi-annual update to the Transparency Report published annually (in the first quarter) and details the Foundation’s activities and their impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem.docs.arbitrum.foundationArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf61.84 MBAs per the 2023 Transparency Report, this progress report is structured based on the mission statements in the Foundation’s bylaws:Fostering Ecosystem Growth through Grants and Strategic PartnershipsEducational and Community initiativesTechnical AdvancementAdditionally, it covers an update of the Foundation’s finances and operations for the first half of 2024, as well as an overview of how the Foundation has helped with the implementation and actuation of initiatives that have been voted on and approved by the ArbitrumDAO.Key TakeawaysFostering Ecosystem Growth through Grants and Strategic PartnershipsThe Arbitrum Foundation Grants ProgramAs of June 30, 2024, the Grants Program has received 1,436 applications and approved grants to 212 projects since its inception.Phase 3 of The Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program was rolled out in April 2024, with an emphasis on transparency and standardized criteria for selection. The Foundation introduced 5 Grant Tracks that projects can choose from based on their development stage, growth projection and type of project. The 5 tracks are:Growth Track: For projects showing early signs of traction and aim to launch on the Arbitrum (One or Nova) mainnet soon.Advanced Growth Track: For projects with proven momentum looking to amplify their growth on Arbitrum (One or Nova).Multi-Chain Track: For projects with proven momentum on another blockchain, but keen to integrate with Arbitrum.Orbit Track: For projects building innovative app chains, rollups and rollup infrastructure on Orbit.Stylus Track: For innovative projects like (but not limited to) math-heavy finance algorithms, onchain generative art or complex cryptography on Stylus.Strategic Partnerships and Growth InitiativesSolidifying Arbitrum as a robust platform for DeFi: The Foundation has led key DeFi partnerships and integrations from liquidity protocols to infrastructure projects, and solidified Arbitrum as a robust platform for DeFi applications. The Robinhood Wallet X Arbitrum Foundation collaboration, for instance, enabled low-cost in-app swaps for traders and paved the way for a new wave of adoptions. Other key examples include Synthetix, Venus Protocol, CoW Swap, and Renzo.Doubling down on Gaming: Key gaming deployments and milestones for the first half of 2024 include Pirate Nation launching Apex Chain as an Orbit Chain, Square Enix (a prominent video game publisher) bringing Symbiogenesis to Arbitrum One, and InfiniGods’ King of Destiny Web3 mobile game integrating with Arbitrum Nova. Additionally, Arbitrum welcomed more than 15,000 visitors via the 2024 Game Developers Conference (GDC) to its booth during the three-day event, which exposed traditional gaming professionals to the opportunities in Web3 gaming and in the Arbitrum ecosystem.Orbit Chains Multiply: In January 2024, the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program (AEP) catalyzed the rapid growth of Orbit chains. The AEP introduced licensing terms that made it simple for projects to create custom Arbitrum Layer 2s (L2s) that directly settle on Ethereum, as well as Arbitrum Layer 3s (L3s) on other non-Arbitrum chains. Major communities like Apes and Treasure have chosen Arbitrum Orbit through open procurement processes despite strong competition, and other significant projects, such as Azuki, Degen, and Sanko, have also been drawn to its value proposition and are building their own Orbit chains.Stylus Ecosystem Growth: In an effort to boost pre-launch awareness, the Arbitrum Foundation organized a ‘Stylus Blitz Buildathon’, where 7 teams were granted $1,500 each for building Stylus contracts on Arbitrum Sepolia. In addition to the open competition, the Foundation has also sponsored developer toolings like Software Development Kit (SDK) and Command Line Interface (CLI) tools to ease the migration and development processes.Educational and Community InitiativesEvent Sponsorships and ParticipationThe Foundation cultivates a strong presence within the Ethereum developer community by purposefully sponsoring, attending, and co-hosting important third-party conferences such as ETH events.The Foundation plans and leads events tailored to the Arbitrum community, such as Arbitrum Day, which offers networking and targeted education opportunities. A sponsored BUIDLathon at ETHDenver, GovHack, ETHGlobal Brussels, and an ArbiBrunch at Consensus 2024 are among the other noteworthy events.Regional Community Growth via AmbassadorsPhase 1 Concludes: As of June 30, 2024, the Foundation had 151 Arbitrum Ambassadors from Phase 1 across 36 countries, including university-based blockchain clubs. These ambassadors have organized over 30 offline events and produced over 100 high-quality content resources. Their online efforts have totaled 1,870 posts, garnering 14 million earned reach.Phase 2 Expansion: With an emphasis on advancing educational initiatives for the Arbitrum ecosystem, the Ambassador program opened its doors to developers, non-developers, entrepreneurs, Web3 enthusiasts, and students starting in June 2024. The Foundation provides ambassadors with the tools, direction, and rewards they need to become fully committed Arbitrum supporters and community builders. As of June 30, 2024, 2,100 applications had been received for Phase 2.Technical AdvancementsThe Arbitrum Foundation focused on 3 key pillars for technical advancements: enhancing Arbitrum’s security, realizing the vision of rollup as the new server, and expanding the virtual machine and the developer experience. Executing on these pillars, the Foundation has led proposals through technical AIPs to progress topics like Stylus, BoLD and Timeboost.Operationalizing and Empowering DAO InitiativesIn the first half of 2024, some of the Foundation’s key initiatives were:Managed the Security Council member elections for Cohort 2,Operationalized key DAO initiatives such as the Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) and Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP),Allocated $250,000 to support the creation of independent GrantsDAOs,Became the first Foundation in Web3 to obtain insurance coverage to protect token holders, andSponsored and co-hosted the first-of-its-kind governance hackathon (GovHack) at ETHDenver.ConclusionThe Foundation has increased its headcount from 20 to 31 full-time employees in the first half of 2024 across ecosystem growth, marketing, developer relations, finance, legal and compliance, operations, and DAO relations to keep up with the growing needs of the ecosystem.The Foundation is dedicated to Arbitrum’s success, security, and network growth, and is excited to continue working hand-in-hand with the ArbitrumDAO and Arbitrum’s community members.NOTE: This report is for the period of January to June 2024, which shall be referred to as H1 2024. Unless otherwise specified, data snapshots are as of June 30, 2024."

We encourage delegates to post/schedule votes to begin before Thursday at 12 pm UTC. This can be achieved by setting the voting period to start in the future. While not a hard deadline, this will help ensure any votes start for a majority of delegates worldwide.Weekly Update Post on TuesdaysThe Foundation (or Entropy Advisors) will be posting a weekly update on Tuesdays on the Forum’s Weekly Voting Reminders sub-category with all the upcoming votes for the week, so delegates can easily refer to the post and know what upcoming votes there are for the week. Additionally, the Foundation will send this update on the Arbitrum Delegate Announcements telegram channel as well to maximize visibility of the voting pipeline.Overall, this allows delegates who don’t follow discussions as closely a few days to see what will be voted on and properly prepare. Additionally, with multiple opportunities each month to move a proposal forward to a vote, the incentive to rush the process is reduced.Guideline 2: DAO Holiday Break: December 20 - January 6thThe DAO agrees to a holiday break, where no new votes will be created and/or voted on from December 20 - January 6 yearly. This is to ensure delegates have a break and can return refreshed for the new year. During this time it is advised that no new proposals are posted to the forums, and only emergency proposals are put up to a vote.These dates have been blocked out as an event on the ArbitrumDAO Governance Community Calendar.Emergency ProposalsIn the event of an emergency proposal that is time-sensitive in nature, any guidelines can be waived for the proposal to be put up to a vote immediately. This would likely apply to only Constitutional AIPs that relate to security or treasury-related exploit matters that are potentially not in the scope of the Security Council."

Changing the rules of an Arbitrum chain requires two things to happen: Arbitrum nodes must update their software, and an on-chain operation (i.e., a governance proposal) must take place. We’ll compare and contrast upgrades to an Arbitrum Layer 2 with upgrades to Layer 1 Ethereum to illustrate why the on-chain component of an Arbitrum upgrade isn’t just a loose formality, but a requirement.Ethereum Consensus ChangesChanges to the rules of Layer 1 Ethereum, also known as “consensus changes,” only require that Ethereum nodes software be updated. Not all Layer 1 software updates are consensus changes - only updates that alter which blocks are considered valid are called consensus changes. For example, after a consensus change, a block that would have previously been considered valid may now be invalid and thus rejected, and conversely, a block that would have been considered invalid may now be valid and thus accepted.It follows that if only a subset of Ethereum nodes “accept” a consensus change (by updating their software accordingly), it’s possible to get a chain-split — a situation in which two conflicting versions of the Ethereum blockchain persist in the network. Consensus upgrades are thus sometimes referred to as “hard forks” or “soft forks” (the distinction between hard and soft forks is nuanced and weird and out of scope for this post).For Layer 1s like Ethereum, chain splits are resolved not by any technical process, but simply via social consensus. If there’s disagreement about which rules govern Ethereum, it ultimately falls on the  community at large — node runners, developers, users, exchanges, etc. — to collectively make the decision. Ultimately, the question of what rules and what blockchain history represents the “true” Ethereum is one that, at the bottom level, comes down to social consensus.Arbitrum ArbOS Upgrades and the Arbitrum BridgeUpgrades to the rules of an Arbitrum chain (aka “ArbOS upgrades”) similarly involve Arbitrum node operators coordinating upgrading their software. Again, with ArbOS upgrades, we’re restricting our focus to changes which could alter the validity of Arbitrum blocks (“RBlocks”.)  As with Layer 1 Ethereum, if nodes of a given Arbitrum chain are running different versions of ArbOS, this could lead to them producing two different, inconsistent versions of the chain’s history. Unlike with Ethereum, however, there is an “objective” way to determine which of the two competing chains is the canonical one: namely, the Arbitrum Bridge.An Arbitrum Chain’s bridge is a series of smart contracts that reside on its parent chain; e.g., Arbitrum One’s bridge contracts reside on Ethereum. The bridge is responsible for maintaining information about the state of the Arbitrum chain back on Layer 1. This, among other things, enables users to transfer assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2.The bridge ensures that its view of the Arbitrum chain is accurate via a system of assertions and fraud proofs. Arbitrum validators can make claims about the state of the chain, and other validators can challenge them. The challenge process is adjudicated by the bridge contracts; you can read about the details here. In brief: validators play an interactive game which narrows down their disagreement to a single computational step, which is then executed in the Layer 1 bridge contracts.Crucially, this means that the Layer 1 bridge contracts need to be aware of the Arbitrum chain’s execution rules. In the case of an Layer 2 split as described above, only one chain (at most) can be valid in a way that’s consistent with rules codified in the Arbitrum bridge; this means that on only one chain will users be able to withdraw their funds. Likewise, in the case of an ArbOS upgrade, the upgrade to the node software only preserves users’ abilities to withdraw their funds from the bridge if it includes the corresponding update to the Layer 1 bridge contracts.ConclusionWhere Ethereum is ultimately governed by social consensus, Arbitrum chains have their rules defined and enforced via fraud proofs by smart contracts on Layer 1. Thus, changes are determined not via a subjective social contract, but an actual smart contract. In the case of Arbitrium One, updates to these contracts require that the Arbitrum DAO pass a governance proposal changing the set of rules enforced."

With the Dencun upgrade soon being enabled on Ethereum, the current pricing structure may no longer be optimal. The ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade is a step towards better consuming the new data availability affordances offered by Ethereum, but will also potentially require further adjustment once EIP-4844 has been deployed and tested.There was an oversight during the ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade where two configuration should be updated for users when the Dencun upgrade occurs:L1 surplus fee. Reduce the surplus fee per byte from 2 gwei to 0.L2 base fee. Reduce the minimum from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei.In both cases, the configuration changes will match what is currently implemented in Arbitrum Nova. As evidenced by the recent surge of transactions in Arbitrum Nova, the network can handle the increased transaction throughput while offering lower fees for users in general under that configuration.Impact on the ArbitrumDAO’s revenueThe L2 base fee change will impact the revenue received by the ArbitrumDAO. The potential impact based on the past 30 days of activity was calculated, which if the changes had been implemented (ignoring potential changes in demand based on lower fees), would have resulted in overall profit going from 816.13 ETH → 79.89 ETH1228×314 41.5 KBWhile the fee reduction will result in lower revenue for the ArbitrumDAO in the short term, it will ensure that the Arbitrum One network continues to offer competitive costs to its users and in turn it can lead to an increase in transaction traffic.Since the parameter change affects the revenue generated, it is important to carry out a temperature check for the ArbitrumDAO to discuss and ultimately vote on the change. If it is approved by the ArbitrumDAO, then the Security Council will be requested to initiate a non-emergency action to execute the configuration change. The goal is to ensure the fees are changed as soon as possible in line with the Decun upgrade.Implementation detailsThe following configured values will be changed in the ArbOwner smart contract that can be viewed in Contract Address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b | Arbitrum One.The following governance action smart contracts will be used to initiate the action:ArbOneSetAtlasL1PricingRewardAction | Address 0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d | Arbitrum OneArbOneSetAtlasMinBaseFeeAction | Address 0x849E360a247132F961c9CBE95Ba39106c72e1268 | Arbitrum OneThe security council will separate the two parameter change actions to enable the ArbitrumDAO to decide whether to accept one, both, or neither. The ability to decide will be reflected on Snapshot using a ranked voting with the following options:Set L1 surplus fee and L2 minimum base fee.Set only L1 surplus fee.Set only L2 minimum base fee.Set neither option and cancel security council action.TimelineThe ArbOS v20 “Atlas” upgrade is due to be activated on the 14th of March, and the following schedule will be pursued to address the configuration issues in a timely manner:5th March - Temperature Vote on Snapshot5th March - Initiate non-emergency security council action18th March - Activate configuration change to reduce feesA non-emergency security council action is viewed as ideal as it exists primarily to approve and implement routine software upgrades, routine maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting.Temperature check:https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x13bcccfeeb736c732bdd08032841d6a07614d17dcee2d29a435e7b0114361a0aSecurity council transaction: Arbitrum One Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Arbitrum OneTaking this route will mean that Arbitrum One network will have higher than anticipated fees for 5 days.The following governance calls will also enable the community to discuss the technical changes:6th March - Wednesday at 6pm EST7th March - Thursday at 9am ESTBoth calls will be added to the governance call and more calls can be arranged if necessary."

Correct email address is: arbitrumdaoprocurementcommitte@gmail.com][Edit 05-Jul-2024: extended deadlines][Edit 24-Jul-24: clarified evaluation period and updated submission dates to reflect the official dates]This post officially launches the ADPC Security Services Panel and Procurement Framework and invites applications from security service providers and software auditors to become whitelisted Sellers on the ADPC’s new Security Services Panel.We invite all prospective applicants to review the attached Application Process and Head Agreement for details on the evaluation criteria and response format.The Application Process and Head Terms can be downloaded here.Publish Date:Wednesday, 19 June, 2024Questions Close Time12:00 UTC on Tuesday, 16 JulyClose Date & Time:12:00 (UTC) Monday 22 July 2024Please Note: This is the only official RFP issued by the ADPC. It replaces all prior summaries, commentaries and drafts in relation the Security Services Procurement Framework.This new panel will:establish the marketplace to allow whitelisted Sellers to offer services to Buyers (ergo, projects granted subsidies as per the Security Services Subsidy Fund Proposal) under pre-agreed terms, conditions and pricing;support Arbitrum DAO’s mission to take advantage of strategic sourcing opportunities available to market leaders;facilitate the proper use of grant funds in a transparent manner with a focus on value-for money considerations and probity with respect to the procurement process;improve efficiency and automation in the acquisition of commonly used services such as those offered by the security services and software audit industry.The Procurement Framework is a mandatory procurement framework. The expectation is that Buyers and Sellers must abide by the terms of the Procurement Framework in order to take advantage of the subsidy fund for security services This includes the requirement for Buyers and Sellers to agree to the Head Terms and Work Order Terms (see Schedule A of the Head Terms) as well as executing the mandatory waivers referred to in Appendix 1 of the Application Process.What is the Procurement Framework?To provide some context on the undertaking here: the Procurement Framework Head Agreement, Templates and Application Process will establish the industry’s first ever strategic sourcing procurement framework. You can find out more about the background to this in the Tally vote establishing the ADPC here.The Application Process Document is effectively an RFP allowing the ADPC to evaluate and select whitelisted security service providers who can then engage with buyers under a pre-agreed set of marketplace rules and pricing under the Head Agreement. The Head Agreement included within the Application Process has been prepared by the Arbitrum Foundation who will be the counter-party for service providers whitelisted by the ADPC.The marketplace will be established with pre-agreed legal and engagement terms whereby whitelisted service providers (Sellers) can offer their services to grant recipients (Buyers) referred to in this Snapshot.For a high level representation of the Framework and flowchart, this diagram will help:Whitelisting Process701×359 37.6 KBSubsidy Applicant Screening1920×969 74.1 KBMarketplace Process2000×1496 201 KBWhat is the Rationale for this Approach?This Procurement Framework has several distinct advantages. This Framework:Is Arbitrum DAO focused and value accretive (as explained below);Allows emerging projects to rapidly engage audit/security service providers without having to run their own RFP process or pay costly legal fees associated with the typically lengthy negotiations to establish service agreements. This time/cost saving allows ecosystem builders to spend more time on building and less time on admin;Generates significant buying power for Arbitrum DAO if used as a mandatory procurement vehicle;Retains open market, competitive tension between service providers. Once the whitelisting process is complete, the ADPC plays no further role in selection of service providers for specific projects. The Buyer retains flexibility to choose the Seller best suited for their scope and budget;Establishes high levels of transparency in the procurement process; andWill benefit Sellers by creating a level playing field for both new entrants and established organisations.The Framework is adaptable in nature. The strategy and model documents employed are based on well-established strategic procurement methodology that can be re-used in other procurement contexts. These templates are designed to be used by Arbitrum DAO to facilitate any other procurement in the technology sector. Software, hardware, professional services, Cloud Services, Game Development, AI, etc. can be procured through a framework established via the Application Process template, Head Terms and Work Order Terms, adjusted to suit the vertical being procured.Currently, the scope of “buyers” is limited to the cohort of grant recipients approved under the Subsidy Fund discussed here. However, this set can be extended to include other groups, each of which can have bespoke rules applied if necessary. This will allow other grant programs to take advantage of the current framework if approved by Arbitrum DAO, with suitable adjustments to the terms.Application ProcessApplicants should apply via the Application Form below:noteforms.comRFP for Security Service ProvidersPlease submit your entire document containing answers to the questions outlined in the Application Process Document (Part 6, Matters Containing Application RPoints to NotePlease fill in the following 4 fields (Name, Email, Point of Contact, Company Description) in the application form and submit your entire document containing answers to all of the questions outlined in the Application Process Document (Part 2, Matters Containing Application Response) in PDF format.If your document exceeds the 10MB maximum file size, please email us your response in PDF format to arbitrumdaoprocurementcommitte@gmail.com.

You are welcome to submit your response before the Closing Time.Following this, the ADPC and DeDaub (as ratified in this Snapshot vote) will review responses for a period of approximately 4 weeks from 22 July to 19 August (however this may take longer depending on the number of applications submitted). Any discussions and clarifications from the ADPC with applicants will take place during this period however all questions must be submitted to the ADPC by the Questions Close Time of 12:00 UTC on Tuesday, 16 July.Points to NotePlease note that for reasons of probity and ensure a level playing field, we cannot answer questions for any individual applicant without communicating the question and response to the broader set of applicants. Questions can be anonymised on request. Applicants are encouraged to join this Telegram group for further communication and questions:https://t.me/+lyn8LCx7_3U5NTU0Next StepsThe ADPC bi-weekly session on Thursday 27 June will be used as an FAQ session for applicants to ask any questions. For any other questions, feel free to ask them directly on the Telegram group before the Question Closing Time.Future WorkThe model documents and procurement strategy used in this Procurement Framework can be used for other verticals of goods and services but are not completely modular in nature as the legal documents need to be redrafted and the frameworks created from scratch each time.It is possible to create legal documents that allow for an additional level of abstraction in the procurement framework - a “framework of frameworks”. Such higher level procurement frameworks are common in the public sector but have never been implemented in a Web3 context.The ADPC has already started developing improvements to this framework for its next term (should Arbitrum DAO agree to an extension). This includes an updated abstracted model to simplify procurements further and provide a completely modular approach that retains a single set of Head Terms and Work Order Terms with modular marketplaces added and removed over time as dictated by the needs of Arbitrum DAO. This future model will also expand on the use of code deference provisions tied directly to on-chain governance to permit the DAO to directly control the creation and wind-down of procurement frameworks.As mentioned above, the Framework has the potential to generate significant buying power and cost savings across Arbitrum DAO if used as part of a strategic sourcing initiative. In more advanced phases, this aggregated buying power can be offered to other Arbitrum DAO-aligned protocols and projects at a fee - income that can be returned to treasury and put toward other Arbitrum DAO initiatives.We will expand on these initiatives in future posts."

This means if you have a worthy idea, not only can you bring it to life, but you can also secure funding for it.You may be one proposal away from a side gig, a full time role, or a startup that begins its life by serving the ArbitrumDAO.Proposal LifecycleThe forum acts as a public platform to facilitate discussion on proposals between the authors, community, and the delegates.It is up to you to prepare a proposal, post it to the forum, and convince the delegates to vote for it.Let’s find out how that works.Drafting the Proposal: Start by preparing a 1-2 page proposal. You can either:Use the proposal template from governance docs,Examine previously accepted proposals for inspiration.If your proposal requires involvement from any other stakeholders, please make sure that you check in with the respective stakeholder(s) at this stage.Community Feedback: Once ready, post your proposal on the forum to initiate a feedback period.You should leave at least 3 days for feedback.Attend governance calls, pitch your idea, and rally community support,Connect with delegates and chat with them about your proposal’s potential impact.Temperature Check: Seek a delegate who can post your proposal on Snapshot for a preliminary ~7 day check.Be prepared for more discussions; temperature checks often spark additional conversation.Preparing Final Proposal: Collect all the feedback gathered to date into a single proposal and be prepared to submit it to the final vote.Ask delegates if they want a final review of the proposalContact Arbitrum Foundation. Find out more about any steps that need to be completed, especially if the proposal is seeking funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury.Contact compliance@arbitrum.foundation to complete KYC/KYB.Sign a grant agreement that will mostly consist of details about your final proposal. Keep in mind that the final grant agreement might have certain amendments compared to the attached template, based on the unique details of your proposal.If your proposal requires assistance from the Arbitrum Foundation like signing service level agreements on behalf of the ecosystem, then start the conversation so the Arbitrum Foundation can work out how it can act as the hands to your proposal.Final Voting: After incorporating feedback, if you believe your proposal stands a chance.Ask a delegate to put it up for an official vote via the on-chain governance smart contracts.Additionally, if you have not already done so, please contact the Arbitrum Foundation to complete all compliance and documentation checks.Outcome: Your proposal passed?Congratulations!If not, don’t be disheartened. Take another look at the feedback from delegates. Sometimes, you just need to reimagine the scope, and perhaps dream even bigger!Proposal ConsiderationsTo give your proposal the best shot of being accepted by the delegates, you may want to consider the following:Objective and Rationale.Why is this proposal important for the community?How did you determine the need for this grant?Who will directly and indirectly benefit from this proposal?Team and Qualifications.Who are the people working on this proposal?What makes them qualified to execute it?Have you consulted with stakeholders that are relevant to the proposal, before posting it on the forum?Budget.Why do you need the specific amount you are asking for?Do you have a breakdown of how the budget will be used?What is the payment schedule for releasing funds to the project?Implementation plan.How will you ensure the proposal achieves its goal?Do you have a step by step plan or a set of milestones?Are there any potential risks and how do you plan to overcome them?How will you measure the success of your proposal?Engagement with ArbitrumDAO.How do you plan to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated about the project’s progression?How can the community provide feedback during the course of the project?Can the ArbitrumDAO halt the release of further funds if the proposal is not going to plan?Remember, once a proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO, the community has endorsed and approved your proposal. The delegates are now your biggest supporters and it is best to consider how to leverage such a community to help you achieve your intended outcome and make sure the project is a success.We are all in this together.If the proposal requires involvement from the Arbitrum Foundation, in any way, then we recommend contacting @stonecoldpat, @cliffton.eth, @raam or email compliance@arbitrum.foundation. The Arbitrum Foundation does not endorse any pending proposals, but it is always willing to help when needed and to operationally support proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO."

To help bootstrap this process, the Arbitrum Foundation will allocate $250,000 USD and support the community to establish alternative frameworks for future grant programs approved by the ArbitrumDAO and as such create a pathway for the creation of multiple GrantDAOs, which","One success metric for the ArbitrumDAO is its ability to embrace an ecosystem of grant programs run by independent organizations who all share the same vision: how to grow the ecosystem of builders and build a better Arbitrum.To help bootstrap this process, the Arbitrum Foundation will allocate $250,000 USD and support the community to establish alternative frameworks for future grant programs approved by the ArbitrumDAO and as such create a pathway for the creation of multiple GrantDAOs, which can be governed directly by the ArbitrumDAO and operate independently of The Arbitrum Foundation.We have put forth the motivation below alongside a set of guidelines, but we also encourage the ArbitrumDAO to see this as a stepping stone and it is ultimately up to the DAO to kickstart a long-term initiative to realize it.MotivationA decentralized ecosystem ideally has decentralized funding sources. As part of the ArbitrumDAO’s mission to maximize decentralization and reap the benefits of such resilience, it is essential that there are several, non-dependent avenues for builders and contributors to obtain support and funding.There are currently several ways for builders and contributors to obtain grants in the Arbitrum ecosystem:Foundation Grants Program, which is administered by the Foundation;STIP, which is supported by the Foundation;Plurality Labs, which is supported by the Foundation;Questbook, which is run independently of the Foundation.While all of the above grant programs have been approved by the ArbitrumDAO and thus have been established pursuant to a decentralized vote, it should be anticipated that different grant programs will be administered by multiple entities, potentially even competing against one another for the best and most effective approach for administering a grant program as determined by the ArbitrumDAO. Of course, there remains the option for participants to follow the format of Foundation-supported programs, maintaining flexibility for the Arbitrum initiatives that choose to pursue this path.Guidance and RecommendationsWe wish to take this opportunity to provide any eligible group, who may wish to set up their own Grants DAO, some guidance and recommendations that should be considered alongside best practices that are in the best interest of the ArbitrumDAO.After all, while the Foundation has an obligation to protect the Foundation and ArbitrumDAO from legal and operational risks in respect to any programs which it administers/supports directly, Grants DAOs selected by the ArbitrumDAO would be entrusted with administering grants directly, subject to basic monitoring and reporting requirements.This is what we would suggest is included in any Grant DAO proposal:Grant DAO MissionWhat is the purpose of the GrantDAO and what does it mean for it to be successful?Group StructureRole in GrantsDAO,Credentials,Compensation.Type of grants administered by the group seeking to contribute to ArbitrumDAOAudits? Development? Growth?Total grant amount requested (tranches):Startup Assistance Grant: the GrantDAO may propose an amount needed to setup the Grants DAO prior to commencing grant-making activities.Grants Manager Compensation: the GrantDAO should detail what amount of the proposed amounts requested would be compensation for grant managers.Policies and procedures for grant application, approval and disbursement:It should be made clear how grant applications will be reviewed and due-diligence performed, how grant decisions are made and the accompanying appropriate industry standards compliance procedures and documentation implemented by the GrantDAO.Additionally, we recommend the following key considerations for any new GrantsDAO:DAO Governance. GrantsDAOs would be governed directly by the ArbitrumDAO and operate (and make grant decisions) independently of The Arbitrum Foundation.DAO Oversight. The ArbitrumDAO will monitor all GrantDAOs. A GrantsDAO should cooperate with the ArbitrumDAO to facilitate any necessary monitoring. This may include transparency reports, performance reviews, checking whether the GrantsDAO is enforcing compliance processes, and whether the GrantsDAO is working in accordance with its stated mission.DAO Clawback. The ArbitrumDAO has the authority to forcefully return any unspent funds from the GrantsDAO back to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury for whatever reason it may deem necessary to do so.GrantsDAO Compliance Process. The GrantsDAO will enforce KYC/KYB requirements according to a compliance policy that is formulated with a reputable law firm that is hired to support their legal entity.Smart Wallets. There should be two smart contracts managing the funds:Tranche / Vesting Wallet. Enforces a vesting schedule to release the funds over time.GrantsDAO wallet. Pulls funds from the vesting wallet and enables the eligible group to use the funds for issuing grants.Conditions for Smart Wallets. The Arbitrum Foundation may claw back funds from the Tranche/Vesting Wallet if instructed by the ArbitrumDAO (or if illegal activity is detected that poses a material risk to the ArbitrumDAO). All grants issued from the GrantsDAO wallet should be subject to a time-delay of ~2 days to enable the GrantsDAO to implement a process to clawback/safeguarding of funds, if for example, the GrantDAO’s wallet keys are compromised.Fund transfer. Assuming the GrantDAO proposal passes, then grant funds will be sent differently depending on whether the GrantsDAO is ready (e.g. whether it has formed an entity, completed KYC, and executed a GrantsDAO Agreement):GrantsDAO has already setup a legal entity. From the ArbitrumDAO Treasury directly to the Tranche / Vesting Wallet smart contract wallet for that particular GrantDAO.GrantsDAO has not yet setup a legal entity. From the ArbitrumDAO Treasury to the Arbitrum Foundation, which then transfers the funds into the Tranche / Vesting Wallet Wallet when the GrantsDAO is established.Foundation Compliance. The Foundation will ensure that appropriate KYC and documentation with an authorized signatory satisfactory to the Foundation (e.g. a GrantsDAO Agreement) are completed for any approved GrantDAO, but the Foundation will ultimately defer to the ArbitrumDAO’s own diligence processes and decisions for approving any particular GrantDAO.Conditions To Access Bootstrap FundsThe Arbitrum Foundation has allocated $250,000 USD to support the ArbitrumDAO community (including teams that are already building on Arbitrum, new groups seeking to contribute to the ArbitrumDAO, ArbitrumDAO delegates etc.) to set up new and independent GrantDAOs. It will be spent on a first-come-first-serve basis by engaging leading full service law firms (as provided by international reputable directories) alongside miscellaneous costs. This initiative should be viewed as a stop-gap until a larger initiative emerges from the ArbitrumDAO.The funds can be accessed by prospective GrantsDAO applicants if the following conditions are met:A temperature check vote (snapshot) that has passed and achieved Quorum;There are no suspicions that the GrantsDAO will perform illegal activities; andThe GrantsDAO agrees to the guidance and recommendations of this program."

Abstract
This AIP seeks funding for the development & integration of zkFetch, a zero-knowledge proof-based data fetching service, into the Arbitrum ecosystem. zkFetch will provide cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving oracle solution for any off-chain data, enhancing Arbitrum Ecosystems DApp’s security ","Note: This is an initial draft of the proposal. The content will be refined and updated based on community feedback and discussions. Your input is crucial in shaping the final version.AbstractThis AIP seeks funding for the development & integration of zkFetch, a zero-knowledge proof-based data fetching service, into the Arbitrum ecosystem. zkFetch will provide cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving oracle solution for any off-chain data, enhancing Arbitrum Ecosystems DApp’s security and enabling innovative use cases like Prediction Markets, RWA and AI requiring trust and transparency.MotivationThe integration of zkFetch into Arbitrum addresses some of the important challenges in the current web3 landscape while opening up new possibilities for the ecosystem:Enhancing Oracle Security and Privacy:In web3, the Current oracle systems lack robust cryptographic verifiability and privacy preservation. This exposes DApps to manipulation risks and limits the integration of sensitive real-world data.zkFetch provides a zero-knowledge proof-based solution, offering unparalleled security and privacy.Overcoming Existing Trade-offs:Traditional oracle solutions often compromise between security, privacy, and flexibility. These trade-offs restrict the types of off-chain data that can be reliably integrated.zkFetch’s unique approach allows for secure, private, and flexible data integration without compromises.Attracting Developers and Projects:By offering a zkTLS-powered oracle solution, Arbitrum can attract more developers and projects to its ecosystem. The enhanced security and privacy features will appeal to projects dealing with sensitive data or complex financial applications. This influx of talent and projects can significantly boost Arbitrum’s ecosystem growth and diversity.Enabling New Use Cases:zkFetch’s ability to securely integrate any off-chain data opens up possibilities for innovative applications.Potential new use cases include:Dapps with cryptographically verified, temper-proofs price feeds.Verifiable real-world asset (RWA) tokenizationPrediction Markets on any off-chain data integrationsPositioning Arbitrum as a Leader in L2 Innovation:Implementing zkFetch showcases Arbitrum’s commitment to adopting new technology like zkTLS. Early adoption of zkTLS-powered oracle technology can give Arbitrum a competitive edge in the L2 space.Facilitating Institutional Adoption:The enhanced privacy and security features of zkFetch can make Arbitrum more appealing to institutional players. This can potentially lead to increased liquidity and more sophisticated financial products on the platform.RationaleThe integration of zkFetch aligns perfectly with Arbitrum’s mission to provide a secure, scalable, and developer-friendly Layer 2 solution. Here’s how zkFetch’s unique features support Arbitrum’s core values and objectives:Enhanced Security without Compromising Performance:zkFetch’s zkTLS infrastructure provides cryptographic guarantees for data integrity.Zero-knowledge proofs are generated in less than 4 seconds, even on low-compute devices, ensuring that Arbitrum’s high-performance standards are maintained.This rapid proof generation allows for real-time, secure data updates without exposing API keys critical for Dapps on Arbitrum.Scalability and Flexibility:zkFetch is compatible with any HTTPS endpoint, allowing Arbitrum to easily scale its oracle capabilities to any data source.The ability to generate data proofs for any reputed and trusted data providers ensures that Arbitrum can quickly adapt to new data needs.This flexibility supports Arbitrum’s goal of being a versatile platform for a wide range of DApps.Privacy-Preserving Operations:zkFetch enables the use of private API keys and sensitive endpoints without on-chain exposure.This aligns with Arbitrum’s commitment to user privacy and opens up possibilities for handling confidential data in DeFi operations.Developer-Friendly Integration:zkFetch’s can seamlessly embeds in both Web2 and Web3 applications, lowering the barrier for developers to build on Arbitrum.No plugins or additional apps are required on the user-end, simplifying the development and user experience.Proven Track Record:zkFetch leverages zkTLS Infrastructure by Reclaim Protocol, that has been successfully deployed on multiple chains (30+) including Arbitrum, Sui, Polygon, Solana, Optimism, Base and many others, also integrated with Ethereum Attestation Services.Within a span of one year, over 20 projects in production have already integrated this zkTLS infrastructure, building innovative use cases such as DID, Proof of Personhood, RWA, prediction markets, and more.Future-Proofing the Oracle System:The modular design of zkFetch ensures adaptability to Arbitrum’s evolving architecture.The underlying zero-knowledge proof system can be updated to more efficient protocols as technology advances, without requiring major changes to the Arbitrum infrastructure.Expanding Use Cases:zkFetch’s capability to handle various data types beyond crypto price feeds (e.g., Sport Data, News, Global Bonds, Commodities Prices) opens up new possibilities for innovative DApps on Arbitrum.This aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of being a comprehensive platform for diverse blockchain applications.By integrating zkFetch, Arbitrum not only enhances its oracle capabilities but also solidifies its status as a leading, secure, and developer-friendly Layer 2 solution. The synergy between zkFetch’s features and Arbitrum’s objectives guarantees that this integration will create substantial value for the entire ecosystem.Key TermszkFetch: A library that extends standard HTTP fetch operations with zero-knowledge proof components.zkTLS: An infrastructure that secures communication during the handshake mechanism in Transport Layer Security (TLS), provided by Reclaim Protocol.Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): Cryptographic methods allowing one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.SpecificationszkFetch is a library that extends the functionality of a standard HTTP fetch operation by adding a ZKP component. It is built on top of the Reclaim Protocol, which provides the underlying infrastructure(Open-source) for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs. It can fetch data from any remote resources and generate a cryptographic proof of the fetch operation and its result, without revealing sensitive information like API keys or private headers.Key Components -Secure Data Retrieval:Initiates HTTPS requests to any specified endpointEmploys custom TLS implementation for secure communicationSupports various HTTP methods and custom headersDecentralized Proxy Witnessing:Routes requests through HTTP Proxies for additional securityMitigates man-in-the-middle attack risksZero-Knowledge Proof Generation:Utilizes Reclaim Protocol to create proofs of data integrity, source authenticity, and parameter correctnessOn-chain Verification:Enables efficient verification of proofs directly on the Arbitrum.image777×630 16.8 KBOur approach with zkFetch is driven by several key factors:Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): We chose to leverage ZKPs because they offer a unique combination of data integrity and privacy. This allows us to verify the authenticity of data without revealing sensitive information, addressing a critical gap in current oracle solutions.HTTP Extension: By extending standard HTTP fetch operations, we ensure compatibility with existing web infrastructure while adding cryptographic guarantees. This approach allows for easy integration with a wide range of data sources without requiring significant changes to their existing systems.Decentralized Proxy Witnessing: Routing requests through HTTP Proxies adds an extra layer of security and decentralization. This mitigates risks associated with centralized oracle systems and enhances resistance to manipulation attempts.Flexibility in Data Sourcing: Our agnostic approach to data sources, supporting any HTTPS endpoint, maximizes the potential use cases for zkFetch. This flexibility is crucial for the diverse needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem.Cross-Chain Compatibility: Designing zkFetch to work across various blockchains ensures that Arbitrum can easily interact with other ecosystems, promoting interoperability and expanding the potential for cross-chain applications.Customizable Proof Parameters: This feature allows developers to tailor the security and compliance aspects of data fetching to their specific needs, enhancing the versatility of the solution.We have already developed a DataDao, testing zkFetch’s capabilities with various data feed APIs, demonstrating our readiness to adapt the technology for Arbitrum. We are aiming to become the nexus for acquiring diverse, cryptographically verified, tamper-proof, and highly secure data across Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.Our project depends on the Reclaim Protocol, specifically its attestor network, to verify that data is received from the correct source. This dependency is essential because:The Reclaim Protocol’s attestor network is a core component of zkFetch’s security model, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of fetched dataIt provides the infrastructure for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs, which is crucial for zkFetch’s privacy-preserving featureThe attestor network helps in maintaining the decentralized nature of the oracle system, enhancing its reliability and resistance to manipulationThe Reclaim Protocol’s zkTLS infrastructure is integral to zkFetch’s core functionality, providing a unique and irreplaceable foundation for secure data fetching. This established system offers unparalleled expertise in zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized attestation, making it essential for delivering a robust, tamper-resistant oracle solution on Arbitrum.Steps to ImplementMilestone 1: Research & Development Phase (6-8 Weeks)Adapt zkFetch for Arbitrum’s architectureDevelop and deploy specific smart contracts to handle data feed responses from various providers, ensuring they can publish proofs on-chainEffectively deploy Semaphore ContractsOptimize zkProof generation and verificationIntegrate with multiple data providers to demonstrate the capabilities of zkFetch.Estimated cost: $30,000Milestone 2: Testing and Documentation (4-5 Weeks)Comprehensive unit testing of core functions to ensure functionality and robustnessCreate detailed developer documentation and test guidesEstimated cost: $10,000Milestone 3: Community Engagement and Marketing (2-4 Weeks)Publish a blog post and host a community call to detail zkFetch Oracle solution and its benefits to the Arbitrum ecosystemInitiate co-marketing efforts with Arbitrum to help onboard projects & Developers to integrate zkFetch in their applications.Estimated cost: $2,000Milestone 4: Integrate Diverse Data feeds (6-7 weeks):Adding APIs for data feeds like crypto prices, sport data, and others.Target to integrate at least 5-6 high-quality data providers initially.Estimated cost:  $10000Milestone 5: Mainnet Deployment and Support (5-6 weeks):Conduct final testing and deploy to Arbitrum mainnetIntegrate with 2 DApps from the Arbitrum ecosystem, focusing on use cases like Prediction Markets, RWA tokenization, and othersProvide continuous development support post-integration, led by Integration Support Developer from ReclaimEstimated cost: $10,000After successful integration and completion of all milestones, we will implement the following monthly budget to ensure the sustainability of the zkFetch oracle service:To keep the oracle service running after covering all the milestones, we will require funding of $10,000 per month for the next 4 quarters. This fund will help us cover various data feed APIs subscriptions, zkFetch development, research and maintenance. We will be sharing monthly reports detailing how this budget is being used and the ongoing developments of zkFetch.We request co-marketing support from Arbitrum to:Promote the zkFetch oracle solution to Arbitrum Ecosystem and developersHighlight the unique value proposition of cryptographically verified data feeds in joint marketing materialsFacilitate introductions to key projects and data providers in the Arbitrum ecosystemBy implementing zkFetch and integrating reputable data providers for diverse data sources, we aim to establish Arbitrum as the go-to platform for secure, verifiable real-world data in the blockchain space, driving significant ecosystem growth and innovation.TimelineMilestone 1 (Research & Development):  6- 8 WeeksMilestone 2 (Testing and Documentation): 4-5 WeeksMilestone 3 (Marketing & Community Engagement): 2-4 WeeksMilestone 4 (Integrate Diverse Data feeds ): 6-7 WeeksMilestone 5 (Mainnet Deployment and Support): 4-6 weeksTo accomplish the milestones outlined above, the entire project will require 1 Project Manager, 3 Developers, 1 BD manager, 1 Dev Relations Lead, and 1 Integration Support Developer.Overall CostTotal Cost: $62,000 (Covering all the milestones) + $10,000 per month (recurring cost)Breakdown:Development: $30,000Testing and Documentation: $10,000Marketing & Community Engagement: $2000Integrate Diverse Data feeds: $10000Mainnet Deployment and Support: $10,000Monthly budget after covering all the milestones: $10,000 per monthOngoing maintenance and developer support will be provided by the Reclaim Protocol team as part of their commitment to the zkFetch.Revenue-Sharing ModelTo ensure a mutually beneficial partnership and incentivize long-term collaboration, we propose a two-tier revenue-sharing model with the DAO based on the volume of data fetches processed through zkFetch in the Arbitrum ecosystem:3% revenue share per month for up to 250K data fetches.10% revenue share per month for volumes exceeding 250K data fetches.This model allows for sustainable growth during the early stages of development while ensuring that as adoption scales, Arbitrum benefits proportionally from zkFetch’s success. We believe this approach aligns our long-term goals with the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth and will enable us to contribute meaningfully to the broader community.TeamzkFetch leverages the zkTLS infrastructure developed by Reclaim Protocol, a project led by the team at CreatorOS Inc.

The pilot aims to swap with 3-7, with a maximum swap budget of 2M ARB and a cap of 0.5M ARB per project.We foresee token swaps as a complimentary mechanism to the current incentive programs for Arbitrum DAO to participate in the development and success of its ecosystem projects.MotivationOne of the primary limitations of the initial incentive programs is that they were all one-directional, with Arbitrum treasury allocating ARB to projects and only receiving network transaction revenue in return. While project growth resulting in additional network activity does provide some upside for Arbitrum treasury, the effects will likely take years to accrue to a point where the net resources flow of the Treasury is positive, only once Arbitrum and the applications on top reach maturity.Token swaps provide a robust mechanism for value alignment and bidirectional upside between organizations. In addition to potential financial benefits, they come with governance and utility perks associated with tokens.Moreover, Treasure DAO’s recent move from Arbitrum to ZKsync has shown that bidirectional, long-term alignment is even more critical, especially for protocols that play an essential role in the ArbitrumDAO ecosystem and have received significant ARB incentives.By embedding Token Swaps as a vital element of Arbitrum Ecosystem Development and critical programs such as LTIP, Arbitrum can continue pro-actively incentivizing ecosystem growth while receiving additional upside and leverage in the most promising project’s building in its ecosystem.The detailed Token Swaps to DAO Token Swaps as Ecosystem Enablers report, produced by LuukDAO and JashFi through the Thank ARB Firestarters Program powered by Thrive Protocol, offers insights from over 50 DAO token swaps, which are the basis for this pilot proposal.RationaleThe Token Swap Pilot contributes to Arbitrum DAO by:Increase bi-directional alignment with top ecosystem projects.Gain valuable insights into strategies for ecosystem development, which can inform grant and incentive programs like STIP and LTIPP.Create incentives for protocols to remain loyal to Arbitrum through a token swap program. In the pilot phase, reward those who held on to (at least 50%) of their initial ARB airdrop.Steps to ImplementProjects eligible for a swapDuring the initial Token Swap discussion, it became clear that stakeholders and delegates value the ecosystem alignment and contribution nearly as much as the financial upside. To optimize Arbitrum ecosystem alignment and longevity, the Token Swap Pilot prioritizes projects with significant past engagement with Arbitrum.Only projects that received the initial ARB airdrop and still hold at least 50% of their tokens, participated in one of the STIP or LTIPP programs, and have a token available on Arbitrum Mainnet will be eligible for this pilot.19 projects that fall within this category have been identified. These projects still hold over 27,2M ARB in their treasury and have received significant rewards from the incentive programs. The complete list can be viewed here. Any project that does not fall within the above categories will not be eligible for the Arbitrum Token Swaps Pilot. Still, if the pilot is successful, it may be an addition to future grant programs and expanded to prior STIP or LTIPP grantees.To determine the exact swap size, the following parameters will be considered by the Committee members:Airdrop Size:Airdrop % Sold:Incentive Rewards received:Market Cap:FDV:Lifetime Fees Generated:6 month Fees Generated:Lifetime GAS consumed:6 month GAS consumed:% of protocol usage on Arbitrum:Project Treasury Size currently:Token Pool depth on Arbitrum:Token Utility:ARB utility plan:Swaps will be executed through Hedgey Finance’s Token Swap solution, the most used DAO token swap solution.Note: If insufficient projects are willing to participate in the exchange, we’ll explore alternativeeligibility requirements and submit an additional Snapshot vote to ratify these changes.Token Swap BudgetThe Arbitrum Token Swap Pilot will have a Token Swap budget of up to 2M ARB, which the Pilot Council will manage through the MSS multi-sig.The initial pilot program is anticipated to conduct between 3-7 token swaps.Each swap is capped at a maximum of 500,000 ARB, comparable to some previous swaps executed on Arbitrum One by GMX and its partners.The minimum swap size will be 100,000 ARB.Non-Sales ClauseArbitrum DAO and the third-party DAO will swap tokens with a 3-month lock. After the three month lock, the tokens will unlock 10% monthly for ten months. If no Arbitrum Treasury Management team is in place within nine months of executing the token swaps, the Pilot team will propose a solution for managing these tokens before they unlock.All tokens received by Arbitrum will be kept in its main Treasury (0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58).Pilot Program Implementation (timeline)The Token Swap Pilot CouncilThe initiative will comprise 3 voting members and 1 non-voting facilitating member.The following 3 voting members are nominated as they provide a deep understanding of ArbitrumDAO and Token swaps.@LuukDAO, for producing the initial research and various Token Swaps programs@GFXlabs, for being an active LTIPP and STEP Council member@CastleCapital, for doing in-depth airdrop research and being an application advisor in LTIPP.The non-voting member (except in case of a tie) will be 4. @thedevanshmehta, who supervised the token swap research and performed a similar role in the STEP program.PhaseDeliverablesStaffTimeBudgetPre-Swap/ Application PeriodRFP for interested projects to apply with details on number of ARB tokens the project would be interested in swapping, information about the project’s treasury and runway, information about the token utility and governance, and a plan for what it would do with the ARB received from the Token swap.WG0 Members: Devansh Mehta and LuukDAO3 weeks21,000 ARBExecution / Review PeriodThe Council will review each application based on quality and recommend which projects and what quantities to swap.

This will leave more funds available for ecosystem growth events. Delegate offsites can still be proposed by individuals or event service providers and pull funds from the established budget.Key Changes Made (October 1st)This change was made to ensure everyone is aware that the AF/OCL will be involved throughout this process to better align the DAO’s various contributors on a unified goal and overall events strategy.The 3 members of this group will lean on OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that any events organized by the DAO are aligned with the broader ecosystem of contributors, work towards a unified message/brand, and are synergistic with events led by the Foundation and OCL.We updated the Snapshot voting criteria to better account for changes to the votable token supply rather than setting an arbitrary quorum. The language has been changed throughout the proposal to support this change.passes a Snapshot vote that garners at least 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority For/AbstainThis language was removed, as the ADPC looks poised to recieve funding after a succesful Snapshot vote. If the ongoing Tally vote contradicts this, we will again adjust the language of this proposal accordingly.Note that if the ADPC is not re-elected, this proposal may be updated to include pay for the ADPC. We will clearly articulate that change if it is required prior to moving on to a Snapshot vote.The following language was added to support @krst and @Sinkas suggestion of attempting to get protocols building on Arbitrum aligned with the overall events strategy. While this proposal is primarily aiming to earmark an events budget for the next year in order to enable the DAO to move more nimbly while also getting better pricing, we are excited about this idea.It may also be possible for protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem to partake in events that are put together with funds from this budget. For example, if a community member has an idea for the DAO to have representation at RustConf with an emphasis on showcasing some of the products built with Stylus, Entropy, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC could reach out to protocols building on Stylus to attend the event and showcase their products. Protocols could be expected to “bolster” the events budget. E.g., the DAO spends $100K while 2 Stylus projects put up $10K each to sit at the same booth. This increases the total budget by $20K at no additional cost to the DAO, and these two protocols could showcase their products in a shared booth with Arbitrum branding. This is just one example of how this could look, with the exact structures managed on a case-by-case basis.The following language was added to the proposal to address some of the concerns around measurable KPIs.It is expected that the contributor requesting a specific event is tasked with defining the measurable KPIs. The DAO will be tasked with deeming a specific events proposal worthwhile via Snapshot, and we encourage delegates to hold these authors to a high standard when it comes to measuring a given event’s impact and how it pushes Arbitrum’s mission forward.Other minor changes were made to this proposal, but none of which were structural changes. A majority of the small changes were made to reassure community members that the AF and OCL will be involved throughout this process to ensure there are no “competing events” within the Arbitrum community at the same place.AbstractTo ensure Arbitrum’s continued presence at the industry’s most prominent events, and to enable the DAO to host in-person initiatives to accelerate collaboration and increase efficiency of operations, we (Entropy Advisors, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe) would like to earmark a budget for events for 2025 and take lead on running ongoing RFPs to satisfy the DAOs event demands. The 3 members of this group will lean on OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that any events organized by the DAO are aligned with the broader ecosystem of contributors, work towards a unified message/brand, and are synergistic with events led by the Foundation and OCL.Our proposed Events strategy should focus on 2 key categories:Delegate Gatherings aimed at streamlining operations through in-person meetups such as a delegate retreat.Ecosystem Growth Events to foster innovation and community engagement, ideally coinciding with other major crypto conferences (specifically ETHDenver, Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas, EthCC, among other potential events) at the same location. These events can include, but are not limited to:Virtual hackathonsNon-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)In-person hackathonsSide eventsSponsorships of major eventsArbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)Educational workshops (Stylus & Orbit)The selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. It is highly likely the OCL or the Arbitrum Foundation will lead many of these events, which is made apparent by the preliminary schedule proposed below. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a Snapshot vote that garners at least 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority For/Abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.We propose the earmarking of $1.5M USD to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. 4M ARB will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO’s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter.MotivationEvents play a crucial role in strengthening the Arbitrum community and brand, attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem, expediting DAO initiatives by facilitating in-person collaboration, and providing avenues for alliance with other partners within the industry. While the Questbook program has done an excellent job in ensuring the Arbitrum brand is represented at smaller conferences across multiple regions, the DAO does not currently have a dedicated plan or budget for events. Larger Arbitrum events, such as Arbitrum Day, are left to the Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs to organize. The DAO certainly appreciates what the Foundation and OCL do on the events front, but the DAO should serve a complementary role – which if enabled – will maximize Arbitrum’s overall ability to grow a healthy ecosystem and capture network effects in our speed and flexibility for deployment.There is significant value in aligning on the scope/timing of hackathons, GovHack-type events, and major events presence (such as EthCC, DevCon, etc). For example, Stylus represents one of the most significant software upgrades in Arbitrum’s history – it could be wise for the DAO to ensure a Stylus-focused hackathon is planned for 2025 in an effort to bring more developers into our ecosystem and to improve dev tooling/infra. In addition to ecosystem events, it is very important for delegates to meet up in person at a regular cadence. We see how much more we can accomplish in-person time and time again, and we believe the DAO could formulate and execute on a grander strategy if these delegate offsites were formally planned/coordinated.Hosting events requires substantial upfront time and capital, typically involving 4-6 months of planning and $25-100k in down payments for venues, travel, accommodations, catering, and other expenses. Planning and funding events on a case-by-case basis are impractical due to the lead time and the lengthy DAO voting process. Recently, the DAO approved $309k to host an event at EthCC in Brussels. However, the proposal was not executed on-chain until approximately five weeks before the event. Hack Humanity, the entity behind the GovHack event, took on substantial risk by using its funds to secure a venue, caterers, and other necessities without a guarantee of DAO funding. Although Hack Humanity felt comfortable taking this risk due to previous collaboration with the DAO and assistance from Entropy Advisors, this upfront financial burden should not fall on service providers in the future. One off RFP processes would enable organizers to plan higher-quality events with the extra time & budget provided. Alternatively, any service provider can gauge DAO sentiment directly via snapshot, which will drastically reduce the burden of the Arbitrum DAO governance process put on service providers.To ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the ability to represent itself at various events and to create new in-person experiences, we propose earmarking funds so this can be achieved in a streamlined manner. While we propose 3 core events in the section below, any DAO member can make a proposal to utilize these earmarked funds at any time. We are also happy to alter the below calendar in accordance with feedback received on the forum.Proposed Industry Events for 2025, Q1&Q21600×566 16.4 KBThe above events were chosen based on the need to bolster Arbitrum’s presence at the industry’s top events. As mentioned above, the Questbook program has done an excellent job at making sure Arbitrum has a presence at smaller events across the globe. To date the events track has funded event initiatives in the following regions: Latam (8), Africa (6), India (4), APAC (4), and Europe (2).There are also ample opportunities to fund events in the back half of 2025 that align with Arbitrum’s strategic objectives (Ex. RustConf, GamesCon, Solana Breakpoint). However, with the expectation that a more comprehensive events strategy will be rolled up into OpCo upon the hiring of a full time events coordinator, we felt it was better suited to only establish a rough strategy for the first half of 2025 while leaving the door open for other service providers and community members to bring forth their own ideas.ETHDenver - FebruaryETHDenver is an Ethereum centric conference that has one of the largest attendee lists of any event throughout 2025. Arbitrum has historically had a presence here, but we would like to partner with OCL to bolster the DAO’s representation. We envision a very large floor space at ETHDenver (see photo below of Near’s booth at ETHDenver in 2024 for inspiration), with plenty of room for Arbitrum projects to showcase their products, delegates and other DAO contributors to talk to people who are interested in getting involved, and an area for more technical folks to ask OCL questions about the Arbitrum roadmap and tech upgrades. Last year, Arbitrum had a smaller 10x20 or 20x20 floor space at ETHDenver, but this year we want to go bigger. OCL will lead the charge on this front, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can assist as needed and funnel ideas from the community to their team.Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas - MayThe Bitcoin conference is the most widely attended conference in all of crypto, and is ofcourse a Bitcoin-focused event. However, as seen with the rise of “BTC L2s”, Ordinals/Runes/other inscriptions, etc, there is a growing appetite from developers, users, and VCs to build out more functionality on Bitcoin. Additionally, there is work being done to enable OP_CAT, which could enable trust minimized bridging of BTC to other chains. As such, we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence here. There is no reason Orbit should not have a presence on Bitcoin, and the DAO recently signaled its support for Orbit deployments on alternative settlement layers via snapshot vote. Bitcoin has served as the “Gateway” for bringing new people onchain in the past, and we believe targeting Bitcoin supporters is a good way to onboard new users into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would like to work with OCL on this event, similar to the ETHDenver event, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can procure a service provider and act as the point of contact in case OCL does not have interest in partnering with the DAO on this event.EthCC - JulyEthCC, similar to ETHDenver, is one of the largest Ethereum-centric events of the year, and has historically been hosted in the EU. The event in 2025 is currently slated to take place in Cannes, France, but with the recent arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France, this could potentially change. Nevertheless, this is an event that we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence at, and we again suggest supporting OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to put this event together. In the scenario that OCL/the Foundation does not want to work with the DAO on this initiative, the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will procure a 3rd party organizer to manage this event and will be in attendance to ensure things go smoothly. We are hopeful that OpCo will be stood up by this time, so there is a strong possibility that this event will fall under its purview rather than the aforementioned individuals/entities.Other Events:We estimate the three events outlined above to cost somewhere in the range of $250-$400k, and would thus have a budget approved that is much higher than the actual outlays. We want to avoid scenarios where we are forced to overpay for event service providers, have a limited selection of service providers, or need to rush through the DAO process in order to meet deadlines for future events. Therefore, we are requesting a budget much larger than required so that if other community members wish to push forward an event, they can do so without having to go through the full governance process.Instead, we suggest that anyone can put forth an idea for an event in the first half of 2025, but that it can pull from these pre-approved funds via a snapshot vote that must garner 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. From there, the ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe can help procure service providers to put on the event, or the proposer themselves can serve as the project manager/event coordinator. This will cut down on the lead time to put on other events and give the DAO more negotiation power when organizing events on an expedited timeline. Some other events that we had envisioned include presence at non-crypto conferences such as RustConf or CES to attract new developers and users, virtual hackathons specifically focused on Stylus or Orbit with the help of a service provider like Buidlbox, ETHGlobal, etc. It is also important to note, that events with an expected cost under $50,000 should be routed through the Questbook program. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an events strategy for larger initiatives that require substantial funds and active project managers.It may also be possible for protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem to partake in events that are put together with funds from this budget. For example, if a community member has an idea for the DAO to have representation at RustConf with an emphasis on showcasing some of the products built with Stylus, Entropy, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC could reach out to protocols building on Stylus to attend the event and showcase their products. Protocols could be expected to “bolster” the events budget. E.g., the DAO spends $100K while 2 Stylus projects put up $10K each to sit at the same booth. This increases the total budget by $20K at no additional cost to the DAO, and these two protocols could showcase their products in a shared booth with Arbitrum branding. This is just one example of how this could look, with the exact structures managed on a case-by-case basis.We want to emphasize the fact that excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025. We felt some of the other events required a full-time project manager to ensure they go smoothly, and we do not want to take on more than we can handle. However, by requesting more budget than we require, anyone in the community can take lead on an event if there is DAO support.SpecificationsIn order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, or onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack. Events brought forward by either an individual or service provider, must create a post-event impact report (example from Govhack Brussels) that includes a breakdown of actual costs. Service providers that are procured to execute on an event idea will also be required to provide a post-event impact report.For concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal (which has since been rescinded) was brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not have been needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity could have taken their proposal to Snapshot, and because they were the service provider themselves, there was no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passed snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could have begun their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months.This is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.In an earlier iteration of a proposal from @danielo, there was no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that did not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could have worked together in procuring the proper coordinator upon the proposal passing on Snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply and a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote. Note that this is just an example for illustrative purposes.It is expected that the contributor requesting a specific event is tasked with defining the measurable KPIs. The DAO will be tasked with deeming a specific events proposal worthwhile via Snapshot, and we encourage delegates to hold these authors to a high standard when it comes to measuring a given event’s impact and how it pushes Arbitrum’s mission forward.Flow of FundsTo cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin and then sent to a MSS-controlled address .Surplus ARB will be sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required. Excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025.Updates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the ADPC update thread on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our updates thread on the Arbitrum Forum.Steps to Implement and TimelineSeptember 10th: “Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Forum post (4 weeks)October 10th: Snapshot VoteOctober 24th: Tally vote (If Snapshot passes and depending on feedback)November 11th: The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL/the AF and other individuals/SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition. Dependent on the outcome of the Tally vote.We expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.Overall AskThe upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain."

I.e., chain profits (ETH) and tokens that have been authorized for spend but have not entered circulation yet (ARB). The primary points of contention were around ARB diversification, the need for a DAO budget before the conversation on treasury management continues forward, whether the DAO needs active treasury managers at all, infrastructure selection, and details around a treasury committee’s implementation, e.g., how many individuals/entities, are they DAO-elected or appointed, when should we target to have this committee stood up, etc. From our perspective, we did gain consensus that the DAO’s profits (ETH) in the treasury should be turned productive and that a treasury management committee of some sort should be established. However, even on these two points that most people seem to be in favor of, specific details need to be ironed out for actionable strategies to be implemented.We believe that we have come up with a fair compromise between all of the various perspectives on these identified issues, all of which stem from the information gathered during the working group calls and conversations with delegates. The compromise suggested herein will, in our opinion, enable the DAO to move forward and initiate the required operational standards for optimizing the use of idle tokens in the treasury. Based on the feedback received on the call on September 25th (link to recording here) where we presented the overarching ideas herein, we feel confident that this proposal aligns well with the treasury managers, infrastructure providers, and overall DAO sentiment towards treasury management. We are eager to gather more feedback from the community and continue iterating so this initiative can move forward.Key Issues Treasury Management can Solve TodayService Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse’s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield—consistent with the DAO’s growth-first mindset.The Proposed SolutionTL;DREstablish two token management tracks (Treasury and Growth) with their own 3-seat committees. Treasury Management will focus on passive yield via ARB-only onchain strategies on Arbitrum One and create a cash-like reserve alongside a management strategy to cover service provider shortfalls. Growth Management will focus on strategic partnerships by exclusively reinvesting the DAO’s ETH holdings into “ETH-backed strategies”. ETH-backed strategies are defined as opportunities that aim to earn yield on ETH or ETH-pegged assets, with high guarantees of returning (at minimum) the original number of ETH deployed to the DAO treasury at a certain point in the future.Treasury Management ™: 10M ARB for ARB-only onchain strategies + 15M ARB converted to stables or other cash-like holdings to serve as a pilot for the DAO’s “checking account”.Growth Management (GM): 7,500 ETH allotted (about 75% of the DAOs ETH after BoLD bootstrapping), but all spend must be DAO-approved on a case-by-case basis.Since inception, the DAO has spent 19.3M ARB on core DAO initiatives (long-term committees/groups that get funding directly from the DAO via proposal), grants programs, and direct DAO-to-service provider grants according to the August Token Flow report from @r3gen. So outside of protocol/user incentives and the large GCP initiative, the DAO’s spend has been relatively modest throughout the first 18 months of its life, spending about 1.07M ARB per month. The average price of ARB since the token launched sits at $1.16, which puts the DAO’s rough monthly spend on these types of initiatives at $1.24M USD.In an ideal world, we would have a budget outlined before setting aside some ARB to be converted to stablecoins or other cash-like assets to cover general operating expenses and make up for any service provider contract shortcomings. However, we need the proper people and procedures in place in order for a budget to be executed to the expected standard. We believe that the OpCo will not only be better equipped to tackle this issue, but will also have better incentive alignment with the DAO than any other entity/individual tasked with creating a DAO budget, and more data surrounding DAO-revenue to analyze.In many cases it is unprofessional for the DAO to put the burden of ARB volatility on its service providers. If we aren’t careful, we will negatively impact the pool of SPs that desire working with Arbitrum DAO. Given the aforementioned historical spend and the absence of a formal budget, we are suggesting the TM be given 25M ARB with the intent to swap 15M ARB for stablecoins over the course of 3 months. This stablecoin reserve may be deployed in low-risk, yield-bearing strategies or other cash-like assets and will be used to cover DAO dollar-denominated expenses and service provider contract shortfalls. This cash-like balance should not be used to give out grants, but rather to pay out service providers that demand dollars. The remaining 10M ARB is to be used on ARB-only onchain strategies that are approved by the TM Committee (TMC). The TM track will solve problems 1&2 mentioned above by putting the infrastructure and service providers in place to conduct onchain strategies on both ARB and stablecoins while ensuring service providers enjoy a professional/stress-free experience working with Arbitrum. The TMC’s mandate also indirectly supports ecosystem growth by focusing primarily on ARB-only strategies by leveraging Arbitrum protocols.The need to reinvest sequencer revenue is best depicted by the following chart, which shows the DAO has foregone ~400 ETH by not staking its idle holdings.Arbitrum Revenue2400×1400 270 KBHowever, given that the primary goal of the Arbitrum DAO is spreading its technology stack and promoting growth across its ecosystem, we believe that we can do better than just staking the ETH or otherwise reinvesting DAO profits into liquid market opportunities. Furthermore, Entropy Advisors has been approached by numerous protocols interested in strengthening their alliance with the Arbitrum DAO. These protocols include market leaders within well-established DeFi and infrastructure sub sectors as well as projects in emerging verticals that have generated significant attention within the industry. Some of these projects are pre-TGE, generate significant revenue, could solve liquidity fragmentation/interoperability across Orbit chains, or strengthen ARB narratives. These types of deals require a counterparty to negotiate with and discretion until a deal is formally reached. This will be one of the primary deliverables of the Growth Management Committee (GMC), but all deals will need to be approved by the DAO via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply prior to any engagement’s execution. Again, only strategies that rely on ETH and ETH-pegged asset strategies will be pursued. It is important to note that some specific details may need to remain confidential even once the DAO begins voting via Snapshot. The GMC will play a similar role as the STEP committee so that this can be achieved.TMC and GMC: Members, Deliverables, and PayWhile we could staff these positions via DAO election, we believe that it would be more efficient to appoint these individuals/entities given the specific qualifications required of the members. These council members will serve a 6-month term, and be eligible to receive 30k ARB each vesting linearly over 2 years beginning within 2 weeks of their start date. It is important that the individuals/entities sitting on both councils have a long-term vested interest in Arbitrum’s success to place a check/balance on their decisions.Suggested TMC Members:TBU: awaiting responses from contacted facilitatorsTBU: awaiting responses from contacted facilitatorsTBU: awaiting responses from contacted facilitatorsTMC Deliverables:Design and host an RFP process seeking treasury managers with predefined overarching strategies. E.g., the process for converting ARB to stables, how the stables can be deployed when sitting idle, whitelisted ARB strategies, etc. This will need to be ratified via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply.Serve as a check/balance on strategies deployed by treasury managers, and flagging any questionable strategies being deployed to the DAO.Developing a methodology for evaluating service provider performance, with risk-adjusted returns as the focal point.Prepare quarterly reports (2 over the course of their term) for the DAO forum that provides visibility into service provider performance.These reports should also include updates on the stablecoin balance, and provide recommendations to the DAO in relation to liquidating more of the allocated ARB for stablecoins, or requesting additional ARB to top up the stablecoin reserve.Suggested GMC Members:TBU: awaiting responses from contacted facilitatorsTBU: awaiting responses from contacted facilitatorsTBU: awaiting responses from contacted facilitatorsThe primary qualifications for GMC members are the ability to negotiate deals and possess large networks within the wider crypto industry. They will also be required to sign and adhere to NDAs.GMC Deliverables:Design and host an RFP process seeking protocol partnerships through the deployment of the DAO’s ETH, which must target the use of ETH itself or ETH-pegged assets. This will need to be ratified via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply, and it is possible that these applications will be ongoing rather than a specified time period. Some information may need to remain confidential—this body will follow a similar playbook as the STEP Committee.Serve as the point of contact/negotiating body for protocol teams interested in a deeper alliance with the Arbitrum DAO.Coordinate the amplification/marketing of engagements across various Arbitrum contributors, e.g., the Foundation, OCL, protocols, etc.Prepare quarterly reports (2 over the course of their term) for the DAO forum that provides visibility into the status/general success and failures of the growth partnerships being deployed.Specifications / “Costs”In order to reduce ambiguity around tax, legal, and any other possible liabilities, we suggest that the Arbitrum Foundation serves as the custodian/counterparty of the funds at all times. The TMC and the GMC simply help coordinate the process, the DAO still remains as the ultimate decision maker, and the Foundation serves as the custodian/counterparty of the funds and thus abides by Cayman Islands law. While the MSS is great for serving as the DAO’s solution to multi-sigs, it is clear that the Arbitrum Foundation is the most logical party to custody these funds, until the OpCo’s legal entity is stood up, to avoid unforeseen legal liabilities. If this vote passes onchain via Tally, 7,500 ETH and 25M ARB will be moved to two separate Foundation-controlled addresses. No funds can be deployed by either the TMC or GMC—they are only tasked with providing options for the DAO to vote on, and the Arbitrum Foundation will be subject to act in accordance with how the DAO votes.The DAO can claw back funds at any time via a snapshot vote with a simple majority For/Abstain, and a quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply. It is worth noting that some of the initiatives in the GM may contain verbiage that prevents the DAO from clawing back a specific allotment of funds. As mentioned, the DAO will ultimately make the decision on these deals, so delegates/voters will need to review and take these factors into account when voting. Again, the GMC members will be under NDA and only be able to disclose what the partner in question is willing to share publicly. As proposed, the GMC will have members from the DAO, OCL, and the Arbitrum Foundation, so we feel confident the GMC will only have the DAO’s best interest in mind.Lastly, we want to emphasize that this is not a proposal to spend these funds, so the funds being moved are not actually a “cost” to the DAO. Rather, these funds will be used for diversifying risks and creating yield, laying the groundwork for prudent financial management for the Arbitrum DAO, setting it up for long-term success, sustainability, and growth.Steps to Implement and TimelineSeptember 12, 2024: Prelim. Treasury Working Group Call #1 (recording here)September 24, 2024: Prelim. Treasury Working Group Call #2 (recording here)September 27, 2024: Treasury Management V1 proposal posted on the ForumOctober 10, 2024: Snapshot vote to move forward with Treasury Management V1October 17, 2024: If the proposal passes, move to Tally. If the proposal fails, host another working group call in an effort to find a new path forward.Early November: If the Tally vote successfully passes, funds will be moved to the Arbitrum Foundation.The TMC and the GMC will have until mid-December to get a formalized RFP process on the DAO forum, and are expected to be prepared for Snapshot by December 26, 2024.Barring any setbacks, the GM and TM RFPs should be open for Service Providers to apply by the beginning of 2025. Note that the TMC/GMC may elect to keep applications open/rolling.Long-term DesiresThis proposal remedies 3 key problems plaguing the Arbitrum DAO today, and sets the stage for all of the DAO’s identified financial management needs being met in the future:Service Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse’s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield—consistent with the DAO’s growth-first mindset.We envision the functions of the TMC and the GMC to roll up into OpCo once established, and depending upon the OpCo’s structure, e.g., Cayman Islands Foundation entity, the OpCo will become the custodian of these funds once the legal entity has been set up and its operations stabilized. A lot of the ground work around treasury management will be handled by the TMC and GMC in the interim, and will provide the OpCo with a rubric that can be improved upon as it relates to procuring treasury managers, budgeting, transparency/reporting, etc.This is a good starting point as it ensures service providers do not bear the burden of ARB volatility, puts the infrastructure and SPs in place for the DAO to conduct onchain strategies, and generates revenue while spurring growth across the Arbitrum ecosystem."

Although the ARDC term has concluded, the engagement of the members will be officially regarded as ‘concluded’ upon publishing the final deliverables.As outlined in the Final Outcome Report prepared by the DAO Advocate, L2Beat, member performance should not be assessed solely by the number of deliverables completed. Each deliverable varies in complexity, making a simple tally an inadequate measure of contribution. For this reason, individual totals for each member were not compiled, as it would not provide an accurate comparison.Since the ARDC launched in April, several in-depth studies have been undertaken. A particular focus was attributed to the STIP program in individual protocols like GMX, JOJO, Vertex, Silo Finance and Pendle Finance. This included retroactive analyses on the impact of the STIP on trading volumes in perp DEX protocols, spot DEX and yield aggregator TVL, and sequencer revenue. These analyses provided valuable insights into the broader market impacts of the STIP incentives and their effectiveness in driving desired outcomes, resulting in an averageof 1,000,000 ARB being returned to the DAOs treasury.Significant concerns regarding Synapse’s handling of ARB incentives, leading to the withdrawal of Synapse’s application from the STIP Bridge. This incident highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring and transparency in the allocation and usage of incentives. Moreover, risk assessments were conducted across multiple initiatives, accompanied by several security evaluations. These included the BOLD proposal, Security Council improvements, Event Horizon contracts as well as an analysis of the Gaming Catalyst Program.This highlights the importance of post-rollout research as a critical tool for continuous improvement, allowing the DAO to learn from past experiences and refine its strategies. By systematically analyzing outcomes and identifying areas for enhancement, the DAO can build on successes, address challenges, and make increasingly informed decisions.SummaryThis proposal builds upon the foundation established by the Arbitrum Research and Development Collective [V1], introducing a more efficient and structured framework. In ARDC [V2], proposed working members are required to specify their hourly rate in a separate application form, with the payment structure being refined to follow that of a retainer model. This will help to better align incentives given that two-thirds of the cap allocated per vertical is contingent upon actual project needs, ensuring that these payments are directly tied to usage.Additionally, applicants must outline a scope of work for the ArbitrumDAO covering two months of their term (one-third of their total workload), complete with clear deliverables and timelines. The remaining two-thirds of their workload will serve as a flexible budget to address tasks on an “as-needed” basis, allowing providers to demonstrate their understanding of the ArbitrumDAO’s most pressing needs.The final decision on the work carried out by elected working members will ultimately rest with the Supervisory Council. While the proposed scope serves as an initial framework, the Council will oversee and adjust the workload on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing deliverables within each vertical and addressing any conflicts between pre-determined tasks and requests made by the ArbitrumDAO. Therefore, this proposed scope of work will not automatically apply after the election. This emphasizes the Council’s crucial role in maximizing the effectiveness of ARDC v2, aligning tasks with the DAO’s priorities, and ensuring smooth daily operations.The goal is for this structure to gradually incorporate an Optimistic Governance Module (OGM), giving the community the power to veto ARDC deliverables. Unlike traditional token-based governance, which requires a majority of affirmative votes for proposals to pass, Optimistic Governance enables proposals to pass automatically unless they meet a predefined threshold of objection votes. This approach minimizes bureaucratic overhead, facilitating more efficient decision-making for non-contentious proposals and fostering a more agile governance framework.It’s important to note that ARDC v2 does not depend on the OGM for implementation; however, once Tally deploys the OGM for the DAO, a proposal will be submitted to integrate it into the ARDC structure.Supervisory CouncilSUPERVISORY COUNCIL ROLE IN THE ARDC: DETAILED RESPONSIBILITIES AND IMPORTANCEThe DAOAdvocate’s role was intended as a single designated entity responsible for guiding the ARDC’s efforts and acting as a mediator between the DAO and the ARDC. This is fundamentally about representing the DAO’s best interests, rather than the operational management of the coalition’s activities.These operational tasks, carried out by L2Beat included the establishing of communication channels and coordination among members, creating and maintaining a Notion page to document meeting minutes and track tasks through a kanban board, compliance and onboarding processes like KYC/KYB as well as regular updates and the maintenance of open communication channels among several others.In the revised structure of the ARDC, we propose establishing the Supervisory Council, a body elected by the DAO to ensure alignment with its strategic and operational priorities. The Supervisory Council will be better positioned to capture the full range of perspectives and needs of the DAO community, bringing a variety of skills and viewpoints to strategic discussions.At the same time, this Council will also be responsible for day-to-day management and coordination. This dual focus ensures that the ARDC’s activities are strategically sound while being operationally effective, closing the gap between high-level guidance and the actual execution of tasks.This structure will consist of three (3) individuals elected by the DAO for an initial six-month term, with the option to extend for an additional six months. Each member will receive a monthly compensation of 5,000 ARB throughout their tenure. As a result, the total compensation for the council over the initial six-month period will be 90,000 ARB, and, if extended, the total cost for a full year will amount to 180,000 ARB.At a current price of $0.52/ARB, the initial 6-month term would cost approximately $46,800. For context, the DAOAdvocate role for ARDC v1 was compensated with 50,000 ARB, which, at the current price of $1.70 would have equated to $85,000. This comparison underscores the cost-effectiveness of the ARDC v2.The Supervisory Council will operate at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.By clearly defining these roles and their corresponding responsibilities, the Council is better positioned to attract the right talent to enhance ARDC visibility and improve communication with OffChain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation. This approach aims to bridge the gap between the ARDC, the DAO, the Arbitrum Foundation, and OffChain Labs.[A] MACRO-LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIESStrategic Oversight & Resource Management:Define overall strategic priorities for ARDC initiatives, conducting regular evaluations to ensure alignment with the DAO’s objectives. Intervene as necessary to realign projects with these priorities.Set guidelines for financial, human, and technical resource allocations, establishing frameworks that prioritize high-impact projects while allowing the micro-level team to handle daily resource distribution.Provide high-level budget oversight, ensuring resources are allocated according to strategic guidelines while empowering operations to manage day-to-day budget adherence.Representation of DAO Interests & Coordination:Serve as a central point of contact between ARDC members, the ArbitrumDAO, and external partners, ensuring the DAO’s strategic interests are reflected in ARDC decision-making.Organize periodic community consultations on major initiatives, delegating routine community engagement to the communications team. Ensure strategic topics and updates are shared with key stakeholders, including the Arbitrum community, OffChain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.Conflict Resolution & Mediation:Mediate conflicts that have strategic implications for the ARDC or that arise between the ARDC and the DAO, ensuring resolutions uphold the DAO’s objectives.Provide a neutral platform for resolving disputes that may impact the ARDC’s alignment with DAO goals.[B] MICRO-LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIESCommunication Roles: Stakeholder Communication & Engagement:Translate ARDC updates and research findings into accessible language for the Arbitrum community, emphasizing the significance of research and milestones.Lead routine engagement and knowledge transfer between the ARDC, OffChain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation, ensuring stakeholders are well-informed on ARDC developments.Host bi-weekly community calls to keep the community informed and involved.Communication Roles: Communication Strategy & Publication::Develop and implement a communications strategy that aligns with ARDC goals and enhances visibility across the Arbitrum ecosystem.Create branding and messaging guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency in ARDC’s public presence.Manage press releases, media relations, and social media to increase ARDC’s visibility and support strategic messaging.Operations Role: Internal Organisation & Financial Management::Maintain accurate meeting minutes, publishing them on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO.Oversee a public dashboard for ARDC members to submit task updates, ensuring transparency and accountability.Solicit quotes from service providers for deliverables approved at the macro level.Track the completion of the initial one-third of hours for each project, which would have been pre-paid at the start, to ensure timely monitoring of progress and facilitate smooth transitions to subsequent payment phases as required.Coordinate payments with MSS and service providers, facilitating 50% pre-delivery and 50% post-delivery payments for the remaining two-thirds of hours for each project.Collaborate with service providers to submit invoices to the Arbitrum Foundation, ensuring payment aligns with approved deliverables.Operations Role: Additional Operational Parameters::Produce monthly reports detailing ARDC performance, including proposal updates, deliverables, and feedback from the Council.At the end of each 6-month term, prepare a comprehensive final outcome report summarizing deliverables, priorities, and lessons learned, with feedback from working members on successes, challenges and key lessons learned.Additionally, if a simple majority (2/3) of the Supervisory Council deem a member of the ARDC to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the Supervisory Council will be obliged to submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination.Following this, the Supervisory Council will have an ancillary obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post (for intra-ARDC elections, the same RFP-Based + Application election model will be utilised).Risk, Security, ResearchThe Risk Member [Strictly Research & Analysis]The ideal Risk Member should possess strong quantitative skills to evaluate and manage risks across DeFi protocols, with sufficient expertise in modeling, simulations, and economic risk analysis. On an as-requested basis, they will assess protocol design, tokenomics, and governance mechanisms to ensure economic efficiency, incentivize usage, and safeguard systemic health. The role involves conducting thorough risk-focused research and applying  modeling techniques to identify and mitigate potential threats. Additionally, the Risk Member will provide strategic guidance and data-driven insights to optimize risk management practices, supporting continuous monitoring, reporting, and informed decision-making to promote trust and sustainability in within the ArbitrumDAO.The Security Member [Strictly Research & Analysis]The Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews.The Research Member [Strictly Research & Analysis]The Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth.Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.Retainer ModelIn the application form, working members must specify their hourly rate, incentivizing them to propose competitive rates to enhance their chances of selection. The maximum allowable hours for each term will be calculated by dividing the total applicable cap by the hourly rate, which will assist the Supervisory Council in budgeting and establishing a benchmark for future budget planning.Aligned with the principle that “incentives dictate outcomes,” the Supervisory Council will oversee task approval, whether from proposed scopes of work by the working members or from incoming requests. The Council will evaluate each potential deliverable’s cost-effectiveness based on the elected members’ estimated time commitment and hourly rate. This process motivates working members to provide accurate time estimates, as overestimating could reduce their chances of being assigned the deliverable.To provide greater financial security for working members, one-third of the applicable cap will be paid upfront upon election. For example, if a working member’s rate is $100 per hour and the DAO-approved retainer cap is $1,000, they would have a maximum of 10 hours available. In this scenario, the member would receive an upfront payment of one-third of the cap ($333), covering the first 3.3 hours of work.The remaining portion of the cap will be contingent on actual work performed. This approach mitigates the risk of underutilization by tying the remaining two-thirds of the applicable cap ($666) to usage as required. Once the Supervisory Council identifies a deliverable, the Operations member will issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the relevant working member, outlining the anticipated hours needed.This model ensures that:Work allocation is optimized, avoiding the pitfall of completing suboptimal tasks solely to justify a pre-paid expense, a challenge faced in ARDC V1 where DAO leverage was reduced.Working members remain incentivized to perform efficiently, as the remaining two-thirds of their payment is linked directly to hours allocated by the Supervisory Council.Following the completion of the initial one-third allocation, payment for subsequent work will be structured as follows: members will receive 50% of the quoted hours’ payment before commencing each deliverable, with the remaining amount paid upon satisfactory completion. This phased payment structure promotes accountability and reinforces efficient, quality work.Election ProcessThe ARDC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the passing of the Snapshot proposal. A high-level overview of this process can be found in the diagram below.image940×705 85.8 KBAll ARDC members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ARDC [Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions].There will be four separate elections held:Risk-Oriented Member;Security-Oriented Member;Research-Oriented Member; andSupervisory Council.To minimize voter fatigue, the Supervisory Council elections will be conducted through a single, general election snapshot. Candidates will be required to specify their desired role in their application. For instance, if the top three elected candidates all apply for the Communication role, only the top two will be selected for that role. The third position will then be filled by the highest-ranking candidate who applied for the Operations role, ensuring a balanced allocation of roles within the Council.The following timeline governs an election process that starts at time T [‘T’ means the date that the Snapshot vote passes +3 days]:GOVERNING RULESWhile a joint application for each seat is permissible, an applicant may not apply as part of a joint application with other applicants & then proceed to apply as a Supervisory Council member or for another seat.ELECTION STRUCTURE1. Application Submission (T+14 business days):Anyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template;2. Proposal Review Period (7 business day period following end of Application Submission Period):This period will be utilised for delegates to be able to review each proposal as submitted by applicants.3. Amendment Period (3 business day period following the end of the Proposal Review period whereby applicants may amend their application):Applicants may amend their applications in light of community feedback during this time period.4. Member election (7 business day period following end of Amendment Period):A Snapshot with weighted voting will be put up per vertical including the list of all eligible candidates:Snapshot for Risk-Oriented Member election;Snapshot for Security-Oriented Member election;Snapshot for Research-Oriented Member election; andSnapshot for Supervisory Council.The ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ARDC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.Furthermore, a separate document containing the election templates for the Supervisory Council and respective seats, designed to guide prospective applicants through the application process for their respective roles within the ARDC [V2], will be published.Checks & BalancesThe ARDC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ARDC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.The Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:Appointment & Termination: ARDC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address [0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at [$1.73 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 3].ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:““ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 4 (as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:*Snapshot 1 (or any successor thereto); or*another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.""CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISION:ARDC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, with utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclosing conflicts of interest. ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Council who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.To sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.MANDATE & PURPOSE OF THE ARDC:The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also the role of the Supervisory Council, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING:Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. The Supervisory Council will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the Supervisory Council. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).DUTY OF IMPARTIALITY:ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.OBLIGATION OF RECUSAL:ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.PROHIBITION OF SELF-DEALING:Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship.ETHICAL TRADING:Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.TermThe ARDC’s mandate will be structured in two phases:Phase 1: Upon the passing of this proposal, the first tranche of funding for 182 days (6 months) will be unlocked. The ARDC’s mandate will commence 30 days (not business days) after the on-chain proposal is approved and executed. This provides sufficient time for the elected members and personnel to complete KYC/KYB with the Arbitrum Foundation and finalize the grant agreement.Phase 2 - Extending Decision: At the end of the initial 6-month term, a Snapshot vote will be held, offering the ArbitrumDAO the following options:Extend the ARDC with the same working members.Extend the ARDC with a re-election of the working members.Do not extend the ARDCIf the DAO chooses not to extend the ARDC after the initial term, MSS will return the remaining USDC + ARB to the Treasury. There will be no subsequent OTC to buy back ARB with the USDC.The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the Supervisory Council following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the necessary communication channels.Funding & VotingIn the ARDC v1, the ARDC was funded with 1.76M ARB, which at a price of $1.7/ARB amounted to approximately $3.01M USD, inclusive of a bugger of around 30%. For the elected members at the time of the proposal, this would have amounted to:Research – $1.13M USD [Quoted fees by Blockworks Research & Delphi Digital - $960,000]Security – $1.13M USD [Quoted fees by OpenZeppelin - $$750,000]Risk – $0.57M [Quoted fees by Chaos Labs - $320,000]DAO Advocate – $85,000While the Final Outcome Report notes that the ‘ROI’ of ARDC V1 can’t be objectively quantified, the return of over 1.0 million ARB to the DAO’s Treasury demonstrates how ARDC can deliver tangible value. As ARDC V2 moves forward, this achievement underscores the potential for further benefits that, although not always predictable, can significantly enhance the DAO’s financial position and overall impact.Due to the decrease in ARB’s price, the total cost of ARDC V1 amounted to approximately $1.0M USD, which we’ve designated as the baseline for Option B below. The amounts for Option A and Option C are estimated to be around 20% higher and lower, respectively.In ARDC v1 funds were held in a 3/5 multi sig, however, for the ARDC v2, the multi-sig requested to manage the funds is within the Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS) established by Entropy Advisors. This adjustment will save the ARDC V2 30,000 ARB by reducing the need for five multi-signature signers.Costs35,000 ARB to @Immutablelawyer as retroactive payment for the drafting, review and refinement of this proposal, as well as the managing of the election process itself and ensuring execution of all steps pre-commencement of the term. The 35,000 ARB will be delegated to the Immutablelawyer Tally profile for a minimum period of 90 days following receipt of funds. This increase is reflective of additional reviews, amendments, and hours allocated for refinement by our team.It is important to note that the applicable cap outlined below represents the maximum allowable amount that may be quoted by prospective applicants in the application phase, ensuring that total spending does not exceed this limit. Thus, this is not a guaranteed amount to be paid, but rather the ceiling that cannot be surpassed.In response to feedback received, allocations associated with risk have been increased by 20%. Additionally, the figures provided below are based on a full 1-year term. Should a decision be made not to extend ARDC v2, the funded amount would be capped at a maximum of half the amounts shown.Option A: Funded with 1.73M USDC + CouncilSecurity: 660,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Research: 660,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Risk: 410,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Supervisory Council: 180,000 ARBOption B: Funded with 2.09M USDC + CouncilSecurity: 800,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Research: 800,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Risk: 490,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Supervisory Council: 180,000 ARBOption C: Funded with 2.60M USDC + CouncilSecurity: 1,000,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Research: 1,000,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Risk: 600,000 USDC (Applicable Cap)Supervisory Council: 180,000 ARBOption D: AbstainOption E: Do not fund the ARDCFund Conversion (Aera)Arb Conversion StrategyThe ARDC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes, reducing counterparty price risk on OTC desks. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ARDC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modeling and executed on Odos, or Bebop.1570×584 39.4 KBProtocol-Owned ExecutionThe Protocol-Owned Execution strategy uses off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity, model price impact, and plan the execution of active and passive trading.For ARB on the Arbitrum Chain, Gauntlet will swap out tokens using either Odos (DEX aggregator) or BeBop (self-execution solver).Passive execution uses concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC pool (Odos supports projects such as Camelot, Uniswap V3, and more). The amount converted through this position is periodically claimed, and a new ARB position is set in the pool. These can be thought of as limit orders.1600×363 30.6 KBActive and passive execution are used in tandem to maximize liquidity sourcing. Price impact modeling and gas cost determine the intraday trading schedule and size. Historical data is used to determine initial parameters. We continuously monitor slippage, intraday price impact, and medium-term price impact and adjust execution parameters if necessary.Intraday price impact is measured as the likelihood of observable price divergence in the hour after trading. The medium-term impact is measured as the effect of trade size on the divergence relative to a peer benchmark.1148×846 71.8 KBThe example chart shows rolling slippage for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.1278×890 31.7 KBThe example chart shows the likelihood of intraday impact for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.ARDC Vault ParametersChain: ArbitrumVault Owner: MSS (Address to be created post-snapshot)Guardian: GauntletTokens: ARB, USDCProtocols: Odos, BebopStrategy: Swap ARB for USDC; minimizing market impactFee: 0%About AeraAera is an on-chain solution to optimize DAO funds autonomously. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management, which often hinders a DAO’s ability to maintain its runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on agile managers for fund allocation, DAOs face unique challenges, including governance and incentive alignment with external managers.To address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO’s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons.You can read more about Aera here."

The Code of Conduct sets expectations for delegate behavior, emphasizing transparency, professionalism, and integrity.The proposal will go to a Snapshot vote for ratification on October 31st, requiring a majority approval and quorum set as at least 3% of all votable tokens having cast votes in favor or abstaining. If approved, the Code of Conduct and operational updates will take effect on Monday, November 11th, followed by a ~6.5-month trial period ending on May 30th before being considered for permanent inclusion in the Arbitrum Constitution.TermsDefinitions for important terms; listed in order as they first appear.Delegate: An individual or entity who willingly engages in Arbitrum governance and has set up a Tally profile to receive delegations.Community Guidelines: The rules of engagement for the Arbitrum DAO forum as outlined and enforced by the Arbitrum Foundation.Self-Enrichment (Self-Dealing): The act of increasing or enhancing one’s own personal financial wealth as a result of one’s own vote.Conflict of Interest: A situation where a delegate, or any entities that a delegate has a direct professional or financial relationship with, stands to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal or election.Responsible Voting: The practice of an election candidate casting votes for oneself and other candidates in a neutral manner to fill all open positions.Shielded Voting: On Snapshot, delegates’ votes are kept private during the voting process, but made public after the conclusion of the vote.Weighted Voting: Each delegate can spread their voting power across any number of choices, from one to all. Their voting power will be divided between their chosen options according to how much weight they attribute to each option by increasing or decreasing the voting power fraction.Approval Voting: Each delegate can select (approve) any number of choices, and each selected choice will receive the delegate’s total voting power.Motivation/RationaleAs the Arbitrum DAO continues to grow and evolve, a standardized code of conduct for delegates becomes increasingly necessary to create a culture that attracts high quality contributors. As the leading scaling solution across most notable metrics and one of the most active governance ecosystems, it is also important for the Arbitrum DAO to lead the industry in terms of professionalism and transparency.The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to provide guidelines for delegates to follow, helping establish explicit expectations and responsibilities, while also ensuring that Arbitrum DAO’s governance process is transparent, accountable, and effective.The Arbitrum DAO Code of Conduct is a set of guiding principles for interactions between delegates, whether online or offline. This includes the governance forum, Telegram and Discord chats, governance community or working group calls, and any other virtual or physical space that is de-facto understood to be a gathering place for the Arbitrum DAO.Establishing clear and strict rules of conduct can be challenging and even counterproductive; therefore, the primary goal of the Delegate Code of Conduct is to help the Arbitrum DAO foster a culture of transparency, integrity, and civility. The Code of Conduct is a set of written principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody. Delegates should use their best discretion and act in a way that aligns with the Code’s spirit, rather than seeking to exploit loopholes or ambiguities.Following the Delegate Code of Conduct, updates to the Arbitrum DAO’s operational procedures are presented. These changes include the voting schedule and election standards, both of which are based on a series of temperature checks (Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3).The Arbitrum DAO Delegate Code of ConductValues AlignmentArbitrum Delegates should always strive to uphold the seven community values stated in the Arbitrum Constitution:Ethereum-aligned: Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and communitySustainable: Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gainsSecure: Arbitrum is security mindedSocially inclusive: Open and welcoming to all constructive participantsTechnically inclusive: Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technologyUser-focused: Managed for the benefit of all usersNeutral and open: Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competitionGood Faith and Best InterestDelegates should conduct themselves with honesty, integrity, and transparency, fostering trust and confidence among community members.Delegates should act and vote in accordance with what they see is in the best interests of Arbitrum, which encompasses but is not limited to all of the following: Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, the Orbit Ecosystem, the ARB token, and any future Arbitrum DAO-governed chains as outlined in the Arbitrum Constitution.Due Care and AttentionDelegates should remain knowledgeable of developments in regards to Arbitrum DAO’s initiatives and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal before submitting their vote.Delegates are advised to vote abstain when unable to conduct the necessary diligence to understand the proposals.Civility and ProfessionalismWhile separate from the Code of Conduct, delegates are expected to uphold the community guidelines for activity on the Arbitrum DAO forum and de-facto understood gathering places for the Arbitrum DAO, whether online or in-person.Delegates should seek to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all community members, free from harassment and discrimination.Examples of unacceptable behavior include:Publicly or privately harassing or intimidating othersSharing someone’s private information without their consentUsing sexualized language or imagery, or making unwanted advancesMaking insulting or derogatory comments about othersPrioritizing controversy without an attempt at private mediationDelegates should strive to provide constructive feedback that is well-researched and respectful, focusing on the proposal’s merits. Personal attacks are never acceptable.Delegates should be open-minded and respectful of differing viewpoints, even if they disagree with them. Disagreements are an inevitable part of healthy debate, but they often yield positive results when approached in a civil manner.ResponsibilityMaintaining a culture of productive debate, integrity, and transparency requires a sense of collective responsibility. As entrusted leaders of the Arbitrum community, delegates should take responsibility in fostering and maintaining a culture that promotes the principles outlined herein.Best practices of responsible delegates:Participation: delegates should make an effort to vote (even if abstain) on all proposals.Communication: delegates should clearly communicate their rationale behind votes and discussions to the Arbitrum community.Accountability: delegates should maintain knowledge of funded initiatives and hold managing parties or elected representatives accountable.Responsiveness: delegates should use their best efforts to connect with the Arbitrum community and be accessible to answer questions or concerns.Conflicts of InterestDisclosure and Transparency Policy: If a conflict of interest exists, it is expected the delegate discloses the nature and extent of the conflict in writing on the forum ahead of any voting. Delegates that author a proposal are recommended to include a disclosure statement of any conflicts at the bottom of the proposal. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency.Delegates that disclose a conflict of interest are not expected to alter their voting in any way. Self-voting is not banned outright for the reasons stated in this post and based on sentiment gathered from this temperature check. As explained further below however, a delegate that fails to disclose a conflict of interest before self-voting, may be removed from the Delegate Incentive Program or a DAO-elected position.Conflict Resolution and EnforcementThe Code of Conduct has been purposefully written in a manner to establish a set principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody rather than a complete set of enforceable rules.Conflict Resolution between DelegatesTaking the learnings from other DAOs into account, conflict resolution will remain in the hands of the Arbitrum Foundation. In general, it is our belief that many conflict issues can be resolved quickly and easily if approached in good faith by each party. Delegates and community members are encouraged to first address the behavior directly in private. If the matter is unable to be resolved for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it to the Arbitrum Foundation using this form (please see comment in following post for more details). The Arbitrum Foundation will have final say on the issue and reserves the right to determine if the issue should be brought to the attention of the community as a whole.Soft-Enforcement of the Delegate Code of ConductDAO’s are unique organizations due to their complete openness. Any individual is able to participate in governance by purchasing the ARB token. There are no barriers to creating a delegate profile and engaging in conversation. Delegations are liquid, thus they can be added or removed from addresses quite easily. This openness is a significant strength for DAOs, but it also presents a unique challenge in holding actors accountable. Today, the threat of reputational damage combined with the free market of delegations are the primary means of enforcement.While it is not feasible to hold every governance participant accountable for upholding these principles, the DAO can hold accountable delegates compensated or individuals it elects to positions of power. Delegates participating in the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) and representatives appointed through an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally who receive compensation as part of their position, will be required to publicly agree to abide by the Code of Conduct. Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in removal from the Delegate Incentive Program or a DAO-elected position. If the Arbitrum Foundation determines that a delegate should be removed from DIP, the administrator (currently @SEEDGov) will serve as a check and balance on that decision; the removal process is detailed further directly below.Delegate Incentive Program RemovalAs stated in the Delegate Incentive Program proposal, the program administrator reserves the right to issue a suspension or permanent ban if a delegate does not meet the eligibility requirements, which includes upholding the Code of Conduct. In the event of a suspension or expulsion from the program, the affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change, or revoke the administrator’s decision. Quorum for an appeal vote is at least 3% of all votable tokens having cast votes in favor of supporting the appeal or abstaining. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final. It is expected that any party involved in the dispute refrains from actively voting (they may vote abstain or not vote at all) in the Snapshot appeal. Failure to do so will render the appeal mute and the administrator’s decision will stand as final.DAO-Elected Position RemovalAny DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove a DAO-elected representative. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. Unless otherwise justified by a proposal author, the standard removal process will be a simple majority of votes cast by delegates with at least 3% of all votable tokens having cast votes in favor of the removal or abstaining. Additionally, an elected-representative removal Snapshot must adhere to the agreed upon voting schedule and minimum discussion period of seven days. This should be a last resort and many other steps, including asking the DAO member to resign, should be taken first.AttributionOur team reviewed dozens of code of conducts in search of best practices and enforcement structures. We’d like to extend credit to all of the following for helping provide inspiration:Maker (July 2021)Go (September 2021)1inch (May 2022)ENS (June 2022)Uniswap (March 2023)Aave (May 2023)dYdX (Dec 2023)Optimism (Last updated May 2024)Standardizing the DAO’s OperationsVoting ScheduleAs ratified in a Snapshot to improve predictability in the Arbitrum DAO’s operations, delegates agree to abide by the following vote scheduling guidelines. This social contract has been in effect for over 2 months now, but it is being presented again so that the guidelines can be included with the other procedural updates in the 6-month program.Minimum Discussion Period of One WeekIn accordance with the Arbitrum Constitution, delegates should follow the recommendation that proposals be open to discussion on the forums for at least one week before being put to a vote. This is to allow delegates ample time to review and provide feedback.Start all votes on ThursdaysBy starting both Snapshot and Tally votes on Thursday, on top of increasing predictability for delegates, the DAO would also prevent the scenario where votes begin/end on weekends.Create Onchain AIPs on Tally on MondaysIn order for a Tally vote to start on Thursday, it must be posted on Monday given the 3-day delay from when a proposal is posted until voting begins.Schedule Temperature Checks on Snapshot from Monday through WednesdayEach batch of proposals ready to move to a Snapshot vote can be scheduled beforehand beginning on Monday and through Wednesday. Delegates are encouraged to post/schedule votes to begin before Thursday at 12 pm UTC. This can be achieved by setting the voting period to start in the future. While not a hard deadline, this will help ensure any votes start on Thursday for a majority of delegates worldwide.DAO Holiday Break: December 20 - January 6thThe DAO agrees to a holiday break, where no new votes will be created and/or voted on from December 20 - January 6 annually. This is to ensure delegates have a break and can return refreshed for the new year. During this time it is advised that no new proposals are posted to the forums, and only emergency proposals are put up to a vote.Election StandardsThe Responsible Voting policy is an effort to strike a balance between preventing delegates from unfavorably electing themselves into a position of power and compensation while allowing them to still effectively represent their communities and tokenholders. In a normal election with multiple seats, the policy is simple: candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill all the remaining positions. With token and weighted voting, there are additional nuances and guidelines must be set in place to address edge scenarios:Candidate’s are allowed to abstain or vote in a neutral manner to effectively abstain, ie., voting or splitting their vote equally across all candidates.If a candidate self-votes, they should to the best of their ability make the weights as equal as possible spread among the number of candidates necessary to every seat.A buffer of 0.1% is acceptable to account for rounding in the Snapshot UI.A candidate’s self-vote percentage should always be less than 100/n, where n = number of seats.Unacceptable Example: In an election with 7 seats, a candidate’s self-vote exceeds 14.286%.A candidate’s self-vote weight should not be larger than any of the weights for other candidates. Both of the following examples would be considered violations:Unacceptable Example: In an election with 7 seats, the candidate votes 94% for themselves and 1% for 6 other candidates.Unacceptable Example: In an election with 7 seats and a total of 15 candidates, a delegate votes 10% for themselves and 6.43% for all other candidates.Candidates may vote for less or more candidates than seats available as long as they adhere to the above restrictions. This allows delegates to retain the power to express a certain level of preference, but does increase the risk for collusion. As outlined in the enforcement section above, any suspected instances of collusion will be investigated by the Arbitrum Foundation and will be grounds for disqualification.Acceptable Example: In a 7-seat election, a candidate self-votes for themself with 14.286% and 85.714% for another candidate.Acceptable Example: In a 7-seat election, a candidate splits their vote equally across 10 candidates, each getting 10%.Entropy welcomes insight from the community to highlight any other edge scenarios that should be considered. Delegates not participating in the election are free to vote however they wish, but if a conflict of interest exists, it should be disclosed on the forums before voting.Responsible voting is only effectively enforceable for elections held on Snapshot and the nomination phase of the onchain Security Council elections. Once the Security Council Election starts, there is no way to remove a member without a subsequent onchain vote post-election. The same would apply in theory to any onchain vote with programmatic allocation of seats.Shielded Elections with Weighted Voting: A few weeks ago the Entropy team posted a temperature check to gauge the DAO’s stance on shielded voting. The results indicated that a slight majority of delegates favored the use of shielded voting as the default for elections. In order to align with Security Council elections, weighted voting as opposed to approval voting will be the official default voting type.Since shielded voting keeps a voter’s position private, monitoring for breaches of the responsible voting policy will be conducted post election. This responsibility will fall primarily on the proposal author or individual/entity managing the election process, but as part of a delegate’s responsibility to uphold the code of conduct, anyone can bring a violation forward.Discovered violations of the responsible voting policy by a delegate participating in an election will result in immediate disqualification from the application process along with the delegate’s votes being retroactively removed from the election results. While voters who supported a disqualified candidate may wish to recast their votes for another candidate, we concluded that rerunning the election was not advisable and rather it is the voter’s responsibility to support an ethical candidate that abides by Arbitium DAO’s standards. Lastly, suspected collusion will be investigated by the Arbitrum Foundation and also be grounds for disqualification from an elected position and/or the DIP.Proposal authors still retain the optionality to justify why an election should not be shielded or weighted voting. Elections that lack justification but are posted as non-shielded or non-weighted voting should be considered void and either restarted immediately or pushed to the following Thursday.Minimum Application Period: In order to draw a sufficient number of high quality applicants, application periods should be a minimum of 14 days.Where n = number of seats; proposal authors should seek to have at least n+3 applicants before starting the election. Since this may not always be possible, it is simply a recommendation and not a requirement.Delegating to the Arbitrum Exclude AddressARB tokens allocated to DAO initiatives are not to be used in governance. To keep circulating voting supply from increasing, whenever possible, multi-sigs holding program funds should delegate to the Arbitrum Exclude Address. This will prevent tokens from being included in quorum calculations.TimelineBefore codifying the Arbitrum Code of Conduct and updates to the DAO’s operations into the Arbitrum Constitution, we believe it is best to trial the changes for a period of 6 months post ratification of this proposal through a Snapshot vote, with quorum set as at least 3% of all votable tokens having cast votes in favor or abstaining. After 6 months, the subject can be revisited. At which point, any necessary changes or delegate feedback can be incorporated. Depending on sentiment and the changes made, the trial period can be extended another 6 months or a constitutional proposal can be put forth to update the language of the Constitution.October 17th: Beginning of forum discussionOctober 31st - November 7th: Snapshot VoteNovember 11th: Code of Conduct and updated DAO Operations go into effectMay 30th: 6.5-month trial ends"

If you have concerns about the mechanism to define attendees or specific budget items (e.g. travel scholarships), please use a comment. Feel free to explain that any Tally approval vote would be conditional on XYZ. The vote I’m trying to focus it on the format selection.AbstractThis proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates) and key stakeholders by organizing a dedicated off-site event. The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.The ProblemThe DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.This proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.Proposed SolutionRecent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress. We want to build on these learnings to advance the ArbitrumDAO. The proposal includes:Agenda prioritisation (pre-event strategic aligment)Project manager to engage with token holders, delegates, and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitating converging on the agenda. Including snapshot vote for agenda and format.Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format.Defining criteria for attendees in consultation with key stakeholders to ensure both a successful event and capture resistance for the DAO.Facilitation & Workshop Organization:Either IRL event or Online workshops (to be decided by this vote)Structured facilitation process to ensure effective discussion, note-taking, and converging to action items.Post workshop follow upSharing a summary of the discussion & agreed action pointsFollow up with participants a month after the workshop to track progress on action items and liaison with Entropy, Foundation, and other parties to suggest next steps as appropriate.Optional (see voting options):Travel and Accommodation:Accommodation and catering for attendees and organisers.Travel expenses for attendees not already funded by the DAO for travel expenses and not otherwise in the region (e.g. not attending DevCon nor DevCon side events).Travel expenses “scholarship” available for attendees upon request and subject to approval by the event coordinator.Timeline:September: proposal approval and then logistics planning and preparation.Event to take place during Q4, exact date depending on the snapshot vote (see below)Before end of Q4: Post-event reporting and follow-up.What Does Success Look Like?High-quality outcomes and actionable strategies from workshops.Increased engagement and satisfaction among participants.Positive feedback and a strong desire to continue similar initiatives.KPIs:50%+ participation rate among engaged (35%+ on-chain voting rate) Top50 delegates, foundation, and off-chain labs.NPS of 50 or more (-100 to 100 range, 0 considered average)A similar initiative is organised again.Options3 options are proposed.

The budget will be revised in more detail (by requesting a quote from providers, etc.) after a successful Snapshot vote.Any funds unspent will be returned to the DAO.Funds will be denominated in ARB for tally voteAdditional NotesFacilitationThe opportunity cost of this meeting is easily 10x its budget, given the limited time availability of delegates and few occasions a year when they converge. As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND thinking through how to create a strategic process for a DAO.Costs of Online facilitation might be lower than IRL. We’ll confirm this before the onchain proposal, for now costs are indicative to select a direction.AgendaWe’ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.Pre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)Org DesignARB token utilityConflict Of InterestGrant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)Additional work to be done to define the agenda:2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.Hybrid Participation for IRL eventsWe’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).AttendeesFocused on high-context, expert, and senior participants. I.e. not an onboarding event.Open to Top-50 delegates, off-chain labs, foundation members, and top 100 ARB token holders (both in Arbitrum One and Ethereum).Additional attendees based on at least 20 million ARB endorsements (holders/delegates can endorse as many participants as desired).Cost BenchmarksThe costs will be reviewed before the onchain proposal. If you have any feedback on the costs, please see the breakdown here and share your comments with Daniel so they can be taken into account before the onchain vote.A base yearly salary for strategy could be well above 120k. But assuming 120k, that’s $57/hour for full-time employment, and a usual markup for freelance/consulting is 3-4. Leaving us in the $150-$250/h range.

To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time “Stylus Sprint” program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks with a 2 week review period and program length of 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign’s primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.Interested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.MotivationToday, the Stylus ecosystem is promising but very nascent. At launch, the developer experience will be in its early stages, offering an opportunity for pioneers to shape and refine Stylus as they build with it. Teams building with Stylus today are early adopters of the technology and are pushing the limits of what is possible on the EVM.The “Stylus Sprint” is strategically designed to accelerate the adoption of Stylus and help drive visibility into Stylus’ transformative potential to the broader crypto community. Launched in conjunction with Bianca passing, this program aims to strengthen the momentum of the upgrade, drawing significant adoption and attention to the technological advancements it introduces.Stylus represents a pivotal innovation for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, setting Arbitrum apart from other platforms by enabling the use of multiple programming languages for smart contracts. This not only enhances the efficiency and capabilities of Arbitrum applications but also broadens the accessibility of Arbitrum’s ecosystem to a more diverse group of developers. By supporting smart contracts written in languages such as Rust, C, and C++, Stylus expands the scope of possible applications, unlocking untapped use cases for end users and making Arbitrum a more versatile and attractive platform for developers. This capability represents a tangible competitive advantage for Arbitrum, and it is crucial that this differentiator is prominently showcased via its use in high-value developments.The “Stylus Sprint” will provide financial incentives to encourage the development of high-quality projects. This support aims to attract top-tier developers from within the Arbitrum, EVM, and Rust communities, targeting teams new to Arbitrum that can only realize their ideas with Stylus, existing Arbitrum projects with complex computation for migration, and developers from other WASM ecosystems (e.g., Solana Rust Devs), fostering a diverse range of applications. By demonstrating the practical benefits and performance enhancements Stylus offers, the program seeks to establish a robust portfolio of Stylus-based contracts, helping solidify Arbitrum’s position as a leader in the rollup race. The Sprint will also empower developers to create building blocks for a wide variety of projects building on Arbitrum such as reference contracts, Rust libraries, testing/development frameworks, and SDK contributions. Reference tooling and code are crucial to any development-based ecosystem’s staying power.The Stylus Sprint aims to create a ripple effect of innovation and adoption, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and capable Arbitrum ecosystem for developers, users, and token holders.Rationale and GoalsDemonstrate the efficiency of, and untapped possibilities with, Stylus by showing how teams can build never-before-built protocols on Arbitrum and take advantage of Stylus’ efficiency and compute advantages.Support network growth and accelerate the distribution of capital to both EVM and non-EVM protocols that migrate to Stylus to further drive network and ecosystem growth. This includes infrastructure as well as applications.Attract top protocols from other ecosystems drawn by Stylus’ efficiency gains and multi-language support, which in turn will bring their user bases, increasing overall activity and transaction volume on the network.Implement a strategy to distribute grants over extended periods and in alignment with the achievement of key milestones. This approach aims to cultivate enduring relationships with protocols and ensure sustained development and engagement.Position Arbitrum as the most accessible, efficient, and powerful EVM-compatible ecosystem to build in.Provide ample resources, support, and incentives to developers utilizing Stylus, fostering robust projects and vibrant communities. This will drive the long-term growth and success of Arbitrum.SpecificationsApplication Process & RFP Details:As mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.For the open-application track, non-exhaustive categories may include:New developer-focused infrastructure or extensions of existing developer-focused infrastructure to improve the arsenal of tools available to Stylus builders;New applications that feature untapped use cases only made possible via Stylus, on Arbitrum One or new app chains using Stylus on Orbit chains;External WebAssembly (WASM) application or chain migrations (from ecosystems that use Rust for their smart contracts);Existing EVM application migrations from Solidity to Rust (e.g., an app rewriting a portion of their code using Stylus).For the RFP track, the committee is excited to hear proposals from teams working on developing:Tooling to add support for new languages with Stylus to expand the reach and adoption of Stylus among developers. This can include new SDKs, EVM-tooling specific to the new language, and/or reference implementations and libraries for the new language. To get inspired for what languages might be interesting to see support get added for:AssemblyScript - a Typescript-based programming language optimized for, and statically compiled down to, WASM. Typescript is a widely used programming language, with 38.5% of all developers claiming to have used or currently use Typescript, compared to 12.6% for Rust according to Statista.Move - a resource-oriented, strongly typed programming language that offers built-in support for formal verification of code correctness. Originally developed by Meta for their Libra/Diem stablecoin, this language has gained popularity among emergent L1s like Flow, Aptos, and Sui. Adding Move support to Stylus and by extension the EVM opens the opportunity for Move-based applications to tap into the already-massive Arbitrum ecosystem and the liquidity layer of Ethereum.A GUI for developers to inspect and interact with the Stylus cache manager on Arbitrum One. Extra consideration will be given to teams who make such a service/instance self-hostable to unlock widespread adoption and use among Stylus Orbit chains. Example user journeys that can be covered are:How a developer inspects the contents of the cache;How a developer gets the minimum bid price before bidding;How a developer makes a bid for their contract to join the cache;How a developer views the position of their contract within the cache, and/or;How a developer can subscribe to events or changes to the cache as it pertains to their contract(s).A Solidity-to-WASM compiler to reduce the migration cost (for existing applications) of moving over to WASM. This in turn aims to help current Solidity projects reap the benefits of a more secure and performant WASM VM sooner and with less upfront work.General improvements to the current debugging workflow and developer experience for Stylus applications and Orbit chain developers. This can include compatibility enhancements and Stylus-specific improvements to how GDB is currently used to debug Stylus applications, or the introduction/integration of new tooling to elevate the UX of Stylus contract debugging.General enhancements and/or extensions to the existing Stylus Rust SDK, the cargo-stylus command line tool, and/or the WASM VM within Arbitrum Nitro itself.Stylus-specific education and developer relations materials to onboard the next generation of Web3 developers.Tools and frameworks to demonstratively help CosmWASM and Solana projects (as examples) to migrate to Arbitrum chains.The application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.Teams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.Evaluation Committee and Committee AdvisorsTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. @SEEDGov and @JoJo bring extensive experience in DAO grant programs and will help round out the committee with additional perspective/backgrounds.Evaluation CommitteeStylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)SEEDGov Org (5000 ARB per month)JoJo (5000 ARB per month)Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)The committee will work collaboratively to provide feedback and access applications. In the event of a equally split opinion, the Arbitrum Foundation will serve as the tie-breaking opinion.Committee AdvisorsEntropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)The Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.Judges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months, with the Stylus Sprint expected to begin in November 2024 and conclude mid-January 2026. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 8 weeks will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future. In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program. These updates will be posted to a dedicated Stylus Sprint forum channel.Recommended Application Structure and FramingApplications for the program will be rigorously evaluated based on a set of clearly defined criteria. To ensure a thorough assessment, grantees are encouraged to provide detailed information about their plans and objectives for the grant. Each application should include:What their plans are to grow their protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem;How closely the team’s mission aligns with those of Arbitrum;Whether or not they clearly demonstrate how they will utilize Stylus;An appropriate spending plan for how the grant will be used;A reasonable development plan and timeline.Judges and advisors may also consider other relevant metrics tailored to the specifics of each application. These could include innovation potential, the experience of the team, market readiness, user engagement strategies, or any other factors deemed relevant.The recommendations above are designed to ensure that the selected projects are coming to the committee with a high-quality plan and to ensure that the application ideas are not only viable, but also poised to make significant contributions to the Arbitrum ecosystem. By adhering to this application structure, the evaluation process aims to foster transparency, fairness, and alignment with the strategic objectives of the Arbitrum network. The judges and advisors will work together to create the application and evaluation criteria.Questbook will be utilized for hosting the Stylus Sprint, accepting/rejecting applications, and giving public reasoning for the choice.Application Evaluation CriteriaWhile we strongly believe each application will be unique and should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a baseline framework and evaluation criteria are outlined below to give teams a feel for what to keep in mind when applying and building.Overall, the Evaluation Committee will be on the lookout for, and prioritize evaluating applications, that:Can scale, or help scale, Stylus usage over the long run. Examples include tooling and frameworks that can be extended, built upon, and leveraged by many teams all at once.Contribute to the young, but growing, ecosystem of Stylus tooling and infrastructure, rather than direct contributions to individual Stylus applications and Stylus Orbit chains.Focus on projects that aim to be self-sustainable in the medium to long term, rather than one-off projects that can only exist/survive for the short duration of the program.Directly highlight core Stylus benefits and strengths with excellent creativity, including the efficient use of computational and storage resources or security primitives that Stylus bolsters and shines at.Fill a specific, unique niche in the market, as opposed to re-implementing an existing application, tool, or chain in Stylus for the sake of using Stylus (and not the other purported benefits one gets with Stylus).Come from outside the Arbitrum and/or Ethereum ecosystem to effectively “grow the pie” of Web3 projects and users.Note that applications may be rejected for a variety of reasons as there are a limited number of resources to allocate to a near-infinite pool of great ideas/applicants that can emerge. Out of scope are projects that are already being funded by the ArbitrumDAO, Offchain Labs, or the Arbitrum Foundation, or are otherwise nearing completion by the time this program’s evaluation period ends. Examples of this include the development of the Stylus Rust SDK that is already being scoped out and developed by Offchain Labs.Multisig SetupThe Stylus Sprint specific MSS multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program, 300K ARB for payments to judges, and 30k ARB for payment to Questbook.  Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig.Entropy Advisors will function in the “approver” role working with the MSS and the Arbitrum Foundation to process payments to winning applicants once KYC has been completed.Funding Levels and DisbursementTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones. There is no maximum request amount, but requests over 500k that are deemed quality, have a likelihood of being sent to the DAO instead of included in the program depending on the total ARB requested in the program and quality of the applications. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.Unallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.Funding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. The number of checkpoints, percentage of funds unlocked, and criteria for each will be proposed by the applicant. This is to grant additional flexibility as a one size fits all milestone structure is not the best approach given the wide-range of potential applicants and the volatile nature of ARB requests. While the milestone structure is flexible, the evaluation committee will prioritize applicants that backload payment distribution over those that request high percentages upfront.The below milestone structure is recommended; however, it is not required:10% - Planning + Building: Creation of a Development Plan, Architecture Design, Prototyping, Implementation, Optimization.40% - Deployment: Testing, Auditing, Deployment. *Projects will be eligible but not guaranteed admission into the subsidy program per the ADPC25% - Checkpoint 125% - Checkpoint 2All projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above.The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.Grant Eligibility RequirementsGrantees must participate in a case study that highlights their Stylus development experienceGrantees must build their projects open source, but not necessarily free to use. Free to use however will be a factor in the evaluation committee criteria.Grantees must participate in co-marketing activities to promote their protocol and Stylus.Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to judge progress.Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.Grantees must not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.Grantees must apply using the approved program application template.TimelineStylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024On-Chain Vote - Oct 10th, 2024Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 28, 2024Open Application Period Begins - Nov 11th, 2024Open Application Period Ends - Jan 6th, 2025Application Review Period Ends - Jan 20th, 2025a. 1 year timeline for selected applicants beginsb.

We would like to thank the entire ArbitrumDAO community for their valuable input.TL;DRExpand the program by introducing a new and improved version, to be implemented over the course of a year.We propose a total budget of USD 4.2 million (in a year) in delegate incentives, with a maximum monthly compensation of 7000 USD or 16,500 ARB per month per delegate.Creating Delegates’ compensation tiers:Tier 3: TP ≥ 65 and < 70. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.Tier 2: TP ≥ 70% and < 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.Tier 1: TP ≥ 85%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.Elimination of the special multisig, the DIP adheres to the MSSThe DAO can cancel the program or modify parameters, such as the scoring methodology, through a Snapshot vote.Min threshold requirement change: Participation Rate (Karma) ≥ 75% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days. Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.Soft enforcement for DAO’s social agreements: Each delegate must adhere to and comply with all social agreements reached through Snapshot in order to receive incentives.Adding the possibility of revoking DIP Ban via Snapshot vote and also creating the DIP Suspension.Delegates’ Feedback Update: The DAO has opted for v1.5 of the DIP, so a new rubric will be applied to evaluate the feedback given by the delegates in the diverse discussions. Due to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.Note that everything related to DIP 1.0 that has not been mentioned as modifications in this new proposal will remain in effect in v1.5.Scoring Weight Changes:Participation Rate (PR): Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).Snapshot Voting (SV): The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.Communicating Rationale (CR): The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.Delegates’ Feedback (DF): The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.Total Participation (TP): The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.Bonus points update: Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attends to the “Arbitrum Governance Report Call” (monthly) and the “Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call.”For the monthly call, 2,5% BP will be awarded for attendance.For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.AbstractWe propose renewing the ArbitrumDAO Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) for one year. This renewal will include adjustments to the parameters, requirements, budget, and incentives awarded to delegates.MotivationWe’ve reached the fifth month of the current version of the incentive program, which ends on August 31.As outlined in the mid-term report, the program has positively impacted ArbitrumDAO during the first three months.However, simply renewing the program will not generate enough value. Therefore, we propose adjustments to improve the program and increase its impact on ArbitrumDAO.These changes are based on our experience as administrators, the reports we’ve conducted, and feedback from delegates, the Karma team, and key community members.Note: SEEDGov delivered the end-term report, you can check it here.Strengthening DIP’s Mission & VisionAs we mentioned in the report, it is crucial to keep delegated voting power active within ArbitrumDAO. We believe the Incentive Program should focus on the professionalization of delegates.By professionalization, delegates should dedicate a significant amount of time to staying informed about developments in ArbitrumDAO, gaining knowledge of Arbitrum’s technology, and making meaningful contributions to the DAO. This includes active participation in most DAO activities like providing feedback on proposals, attending to Governance Calls, maintaining high voting participation on Snapshot and Tally, and providing a rationale for such votes.To achieve this, we also need to establish transparent and predictable incentives. Delegates should be confident that if they align with the DAO and improve their contributions over time—essentially if they professionalize—they will receive better incentives. These incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount. Delegates should focus on their role and DAO activities, not on understanding complex economic mechanisms to receive compensation.We want delegates to be motivated to participate actively in ArbitrumDAO. In order to do this, incentives must be attractive enough for them to either participate directly or hire competent individuals to represent their interests, those of their community, or their protocol.It’s important to note that while managing the incentive program, we realized that it doesn’t address all the challenges faced by the DAO, such as vote distribution, attracting new contributors, and other aspects. Expecting a single strategy to tackle all issues overlooks the diversity of factors involved. However, we’re pleased to see initiatives like ARB Staking, (Re)delegation Week, and the Public Good Citizen Enfranchisement Pool are underway to address these challenges. As each initiative matures, we can align them to achieve a more significant collective impact.General parametersThe proposed changes below are based on the experience we’ve gained while managing the program, the delegates’ feedback during the discussion on this thread, and both reports we made for the DIP 1.0 (mid-term report and final report).If you want to view the parameters of the previous program, click here.DurationThe program’s first phase lasted six months, as it was designed as an experimental foundation. For this iteration, extending the duration to twelve months is appropriate, providing greater predictability and flexibility for implementing future changes.ArbitrumDAO may cancel the program or modify parameters, such as scoring methodology, through an instantaneous vote.Requirements to Participate in the DIPThe requirements to participate in the program are as follows:Each delegate must adhere to all social agreements reached through Snapshot, including those outlined in proposals such as ‘Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations,’ ‘Should the DAO Create COI & Self Voting Policies?,’ ‘Incentives Detox Proposal,’ and any other proposals or codes of conduct that may be approved in the future.Voting Power: >50K ARB, corresponding to 176 delegates. (Source: Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics).Change: This parameter will remain unchanged.Motivation: Currently, only 30% of delegates meeting this requirement are part of the program. One of our goals for this renewal is to increase the number of participating delegates.Participation Rate (Karma): ≥75% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days.Change: Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.Motivation: As the number of proposals grows, the impact of each individual vote decreases, making it challenging to meet the historical 25% PR. This change aims to lower the barrier for new participants, ensuring that all delegates, regardless of when they joined Arbitrum, are recognized for their consistency and active participation in the DAO. In this way, the program’s approach encourages the active participation of delegates, ensuring a more accurate and up-to-date representation.Onboarding new delegatesA new delegate, without prior participation history, can join the program starting in the third month after casting his first on-chain vote, as long as he meets the specified requirements (>50k voting power and ≥75% participation in on-chain votes) during that third month.image1841×1142 152 KBIncentive Program ApplicationDelegates who meet the requirements must confirm their participation in the DIP via the DIP Application Thread. Delegates can join the program anytime within 12 months, provided they meet the specified criteria. To minimize the potential for manipulation, delegates who sign up before the third day of the month will be included in the incentive calculations for that month. The delegates who have registered for v1.0 will not have to go through this procedure againRegarding delegates’ KYCIt is important to mention that it won’t be necessary for the delegates already registered to complete the KYC again. They will only need to sign updated agreements with the Arbitrum Foundation.Incentive Program Application TemplateForum Username (Link):Twitter Profile (Link):Snapshot Profile (Link):Participation Rate 90 days - Karma (Link):Note: Any delegate who chooses to withdraw from the program can indicate their intention to opt out by posting a message in the forum.Number of Delegates to Receive IncentivesWe will maintain this parameter at 50 delegates.Incentive BudgetBudget Allocation: MAX 4,200,000 USD (up to 7.000 USD per delegate per month).Making the incentives more predictableIn the initial iteration of the DIP, costs were denominated solely in ARB, which led to challenges due to the token’s volatility.When the program launched in March, the token was valued at approximately USD 1.70, allowing a delegate with 100% Total Participation (TP) to earn around USD 8,500 per month. However, now, in the fifth month of the program, the token is valued at USD 0.55, reducing a delegate’s maximum monthly compensation to about USD 2,750—a decrease of over 60% for the same amount of work. This significant reduction could disincentivize delegate participation.The same issue applies to operational, development, and maintenance costs, which have become increasingly misaligned.To avoid this situation, we propose that payments be denominated in USD and made in ARB tokens. Again, the delegates’ incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount.If we want to professionalize DAO operations as much as possible and stay aligned we should aim for delegates to have a certain seniority and dedication to Bringing Value to Arbitrum DAO. Thus, delegates who meet the requirements at the end of the month and achieve a TP of at least 65% will be eligible to receive up to 7,000 USD in ARB tokens as compensation.Now, as program administrators, our goal is to create the necessary incentives to elevate the overall quality of contributions. During the first iteration of the DIP, we observed that the compensation for top delegates did not significantly differ from those with lower Total Participation (TP) scores. To address this, we propose the introduction of three compensation tiers based on the Total Participation Rate achieved by each delegate.Tier 3: TP ≥ 65 and < 70. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.Tier 2: TP ≥ 70% and < 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.Tier 1: TP ≥ 85% and < 100%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.This approach makes the program more cost-effective per USD spent because as the quality of contributions increases, more resources are allocated to higher-performing delegates (those in tiers 1 and 2). Conversely, if delegate performance is suboptimal, fewer resources are allocated, with more delegates falling into tiers 2 and 3.We considered the volatility of the ARB token by suggesting an ARB cap for each Tier. In this way, while delegates’ compensation could still be affected after a drastic price drop, we would at the same time protect the DAO’s interests by limiting its “loss” somewhat. It also act as a mechanism to align delegates with Arbitrum DAO.Note: ARB Cap for each Tier includes a 30% buffer and will be recalculated on the basis of the ARB price at the time of submitting the proposal for voting in Tally.We’ll provide a simulation of what the payout would look like in 3 different scenarios:1st scenario (base): ARB at $0.551600×750 376 KB2nd Scenario: ARB at $0.351600×753 425 KB3rd Scenario: ARB at $1.001600×766 424 KBNote: We will use the Coingecko rate at the time of payment to determine the value of ARB each month.As seen in the images, an increase in ARB’s price would significantly reduce the spending in ARB, allowing the DAO to benefit from the rise. In the other hand, if the price falls to $0.35, the token expenditure of the program is limited to mitigate the DAO’s potential “loss.” This approach also better aligns the program’s USD spending with the DAO’s new economic and financial reality.Additionally, the use of tiers in this manner allows for a significant boost in incentives when efforts are increased, acting as a catalyst for delegate activity. The first tier serves as a ‘minimum payment’ for delegates who, for example, fulfill their primary duties: participating in every vote and providing some input in the forum.Tiers 1 and 2 represent the leap in quality, requiring greater effort to obtain 70-100% of the TP, but offering a higher reward in return. A delegate who provides a high degree of dedication and high quality input can DOUBLE the incentives of the lowest tier.Payments to delegates are expected to be processed in ARB from the MSS between the 15th and 16th of each month.Conflict resolutionDisputeIf delegates disagree with the results presented by the Karma Dashboard at the beginning of each month, they have a four-day period to contest them.To raise a dispute, delegates must post a message in the forum using the following template:Title: DisputeUsernameReason for Dispute (provide details)The DIP administrator will address the issue promptly, with a resolution expected within a maximum of 4 days.DIP BanThe program administrator will have the right to expel a delegate if they attempt to game or exploit the program or if the delegate does not meet any of the aforementioned requirements to be considered eligible. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator. In all cases the ban is permanent.The affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change (for suspension), or revoke the Administrator’s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.DIP SuspensionThe program administrator will have the right to suspend a delegate if he/she/they commits a fault that in the administrator’s judgment is insufficient cause for expulsion. The decision and duration of the suspension are at the discretion of the program administrator (duration can’t exceed the program’s current iteration).The affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change, or revoke the Administrator’s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.ScoringTo determine which delegates will receive monthly payments, we will continue using the dashboard developed by Karma.Note: The program manager may adjust the compensation parameters, provided they inform the DAO of the reasons for the changes.1337×625 43.9 KBNew Evaluation System for Delegates’ FeedbackWe’ve listened to the concerns raised by some delegates regarding the changes in the Delegates’ Feedback section.So, we propose changing the way we collect feedback from a quantitative to a qualitative way.Instead of counting comments on proposals that reach Snapshot, we propose implementing a monthly analysis of the feedback provided by delegates, regardless of whether the proposal/discussion has reached Snapshot.In this way, the Program Administrator would be responsible for creating a rubric that evaluates the value and timeliness of the feedback provided by delegates. The goal of this system is to:Incentivize quality over quantity of feedback.Extend the analysis across all contributions made by a delegate in the forum (instead of only considering those that reach Snapshot).Avoid unnecessary or spam comments made solely to achieve a higher score.Allow delegates to focus on contributing to proposals or discussions related to their areas of expertise.Under this system, a delegate could achieve the same score with (for example) one big significant contribution or by making several smaller contributions. It also discourages actors who might try to take advantage of the program.Evaluation ApproachThis rubric assesses the overall feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions. The aim is to measure the consistency, quality, and overall impact of their contributions. We expect delegates to comment on and/or provide feedback on proposals and discussions both before and during the voting process. This feedback should aim to foster debate, improve the proposal, or clarify issues not explicitly addressed within it.We trust the goodwill of the delegates to avoid meaningless/spam comments and ensure that all contributions are sensible.Key point: Feedback or opinions that violate community rules will not be considered. Your interactions should contribute constructively to the discussions and the deliberation and improvement of the proposals.Rubric SpecificationsThe parameter “Proposal Feedback” should be renamed to ""Delegate’s Feedback” in this case since we’re analyzing the overall feedback provided by the delegate (not just proposals on snapshot) and will maintain a maximum weight of 30%, the score will be awarded based on the following rubric:1290×1010 191 KBHere is a breakdown of each criterion included in the rubric:Relevance: Analyzes whether the delegate’s feedback throughout the month is relevant to the discussion.Depth of Analysis: It evaluates the depth of analysis provided by the delegate concerning the proposals or discussions. This serves as a metric to assess whether the delegate takes the time to thoroughly meditate on the discussion and demonstrates attention to the details. Key elements include solid arguments, relevant questions, and thorough reasoning.Timing: Considers when the delegate provides feedback, rewarding those who provide feedback earlier, as long as they meet the above criteria. Note that feedback will be considered as provided before on-chain/off-chain voting if it was published before the day voting starts at 00:00 UTC.Clarity and Communication: this is a review of the clarity, structured communication, and overall readability of the delegate’s feedback. Clear and well-written feedback is rewarded.Impact on Decision-Making: While the proposer ultimately decides whether to incorporate feedback, high-quality feedback from a delegate often influences the final proposal that goes to vote. This criterion evaluates whether the delegate’s feedback tends to drive changes in proposals/discussions.Presence in Discussions: This is a more quantitative analysis, intended to reflect the effort of delegates who participate in most discussions. This parameter serves as a multiplier to the score obtained across the previous five criteria. Note that the percentage of participation in monthly discussions could be not linear across all DAO’s discussions. Some proposals may carry more weight in the overall discussions (special cases such as LTIPP/STIP, gaming, treasury, etc.).Monthly Evaluation Process1. Data Collection: At the end of the month, the complete set of contributions by each delegate across all discussions on the forum is reviewed.2. Overall Evaluation: The rubric is used to assess the delegate’s overall performance on each criterion, based on a holistic view of their participation.3. Score Assignment: A level of 1 to 4 is assigned to each criterion, based on the consistency and quality of the delegate’s contributions over the month. Each level has an assigned score, from 1 to 4.4. Monthly Report: A qualitative and quantitative report summarizing the delegate’s performance over the month is then produced.Scoring MethodologyEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 4, depending on the level achieved.The initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the “Presence in Discussions” multiplier to the initial average score. The maximum Initial Score is 20 points and 30 points for the Final Score.For illustrative purposes, here’s an example:Relevance: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3Depth of Analysis: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2Timing: Level 4 - Scoring achieved = 4Clarity and Communication: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2Impact on Decision-Making: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3Initial Score/Average: 70% or 14/20 or 2.8/4Participation in Discussions: Level 2 - Multiplier assigned: 1.10xFinal Score: 70% x 1.1 = 77% or 23.1/30 Delegates’ Feedback points.Trade-offsWe are aware that this proposed solution introduces trust assumptions regarding the Program Administrator’s criteria for evaluating feedback. We view this layer of subjectivity as inevitable until we can implement automated tools, such as the AI that Karma is developing, to assess the quality of delegate feedback. It is important to note that, as Program Administrators, after analyzing proposals and feedback for the last six months, we have gained experience that (we believe) will help us correctly identify constructive feedback.At SEEDGov, we are committed to being as transparent as possible, as we have been thus far. Therefore, the rubric and the monthly report will always be publicly accessible to all interested parties. During this phase, feedback from Arbitrum DAO will also be crucial in helping us refine our evaluation criteria.Next steps regarding FeedbackDuring the first iteration of this delegate program, we have been closely monitoring forum activity, particularly during the feedback stage of various proposals. As this phase was a trial, we primarily focused on observing certain dynamics within the forum to better understand them and make adjustments for the next iteration.One of the issues we identified is the use of AI to comment on proposals. While the use of AI for tasks such as translating text or correcting grammatical errors is understandable, we have seen instances where it has been employed to generate feedback based on other users’ comments. This has not been a widespread or alarming issue but, in the next iteration, we plan to take a more reactive approach.Another issue we have encountered is regarding users who post “Reserved for later comment.” We want to clarify that we do not recommend or encourage such practices, which should preferably be avoided.In this iteration, we will try to provide feedback to delegates on this type of situation.Experimental nature of the new delegates’ feedback scoring system.Due to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.Scoring Weight ChangesAfter observing delegate behavior and some internal discussions, we believe it is necessary to adjust specific parameters of the program:Participation Rate (PR)Change: Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).Motivation: The 90-day participation rate is a requirement for delegates to register in the program. Unlike the historical rate, this parameter is more accessible, so we have decided to lower its weight.Snapshot Voting (SV)Change: The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.Motivation: Snapshot voting is a crucial part of the governance process. It is essential to give it more weight to encourage delegates to vote in snapshots.Communicating Rationale (CR)Change: The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.Motivation: While providing a rationale for votes is important, we consider the feedback period even more crucial. Therefore, we have reduced the weight of Communicating Rationale and increased the weight of Delegates’ Feedback.Delegates’ Feedback (DF)Change: The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.Motivation: Providing feedback on forum proposals is fundamental. We have raised this parameter’s weight above others and introduced a rubric to evaluate the feedback qualitatively. These changes are detailed further above.Total Participation (TP)Change: The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.Motivation: After analyzing the program’s results, we observed that some delegates with high historical participation in Tally could meet the +60% requirement by voting on 100% of monthly proposals. We have decided to raise the TP requirement to +65% for compensation to encourage more contributions in the forum.Bonus Point (BP)Change: Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attend the “Arbitrum Governance Report Call” (monthly) and the “Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call.”For the monthly call, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attendance.For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.Motivation: We have received several questions about delegate participation in calls or working groups. While there is a trend to compensate work within specific WGs (and we want to avoid potential double spending by the DAO), we find it interesting to experiment with the idea of awarding Bonus Points to delegates who participate in both the “Arbitrum Governance Report Call” (monthly) and the “Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call”. We will continue to manage this parameter as in the previous program. Although it was a topic of discussion, we have yet to receive complaints about how these points were awarded. We welcome any feedback from the DAO.Details: Terminology, Symbols, and FormulasActivity Weight (%): Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.Participation Rate - 90 days (PR90) - Weight 15: Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes in the last 90 days. This parameter will be calculated at the end of each month.PR90% fórmula: (PR90 * 15) / 100Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 20: Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.Tn: Number of total proposals sent to snapshots for monthly voting.Rn: Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) * 20Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25: Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter will reset at the beginning of each month.Tn: Number of total proposals sent to Tally for monthly voting.Rn: Number of proposals the delegate voted on-chain in the month.TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) * 25Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 10: Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate’s vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.Tn: Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.Rn: Number of honest communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified their decision.CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) * 10Delegates’ Feedback (DF) - Weight 30: This is the score given by the program administrator regarding the feedback provided by the delegate during the month. This new iteration (v1.5) will use a rubric with a scoring system detailed above.The scoring system will use the following formula:(Σ qualitative criteria) / 20 * 100 * Presence in discussions multiplier * 30 (DF weight) = DF scoreBonus Point (BP) - Extra +30,0% TP: This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, it’s automatically granted +30% extra TP. This extra is at the discretion of the program administrator.Total Participation (TP): Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + DF% + BPPayment USD (PUSD): The final amount of USD that the delegate will receive is based on his TP% and his Tier.PUSD formula: IF(TIER =1; TP/100x7000; IF(TIER=2; TP/85x5100;IF(TIER=3; TP/70x3250;0)))Payment ARB (PARB): The final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive is based on his PUSD, the ARB Price and the ARB payment cap of the corresponding tier.PARB formula: IF(PUSD/ARB Price > Tier’s ARB Cap; Tier’s ARB Cap; (PUSD/ARB Price))Note: Here is the framework template for delegates to review the parameters.Parameter summaryActivity Weight (%):Participation Rate 90 (PR90) - Weight 15%Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 20%Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 10%Delegates’ Feedback (DF) - Weight 30%Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30%Total Participation (TP):TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %PF + BPAdministrative BudgetWe have updated the operational costs for administering this new program. This payment will be distributed over 12 months and sent regularly along with the payments to the delegates.Karma Details:$7,250/month * 12 = $87,000 for continuing to build and enhance the dashboard.SEEDGov Details:2 Program Administrators (2 Full-time): $157,000 over 12 months.1 Data Analyst (Part-Time): $35,000 over 12 months.Total: $192,000 ($16,000 per month)Source: Salaries are approximate and based on U.S. standards. We extracted data from this website.Program growth clauseAlthough the proposed administrative budget is sufficient in both versions, we understand that if there is a considerable increase in registrations, the workload would increase significantly. That is why we will incorporate a clause where if the program exceeds 65 registered delegates (which is the number that we believe we could cover with the budget requested) we will reopen discussions in the forum on the budget, also considering the possibility of increasing the number of delegates incentivized.Budget SummaryUSD 4,200,000 in Incentives. Delegates’ compensations are capped at 16,500 ARB per delegate per month (Tier 1), which means the maximum spending on incentives would be 9,900,000 ARB per year (16,500 ARB x 50 delegates x 12 months). This amount represents 0.31% of the DAO’s treasury. The ARB cap already includes a 30% buffer and it will be recalculated before Tally.USD 87,000 +30% ARB buffer for Dashboard maintenance and upgradeUSD 192,000 +30% ARB buffer for Operational Costs/Program Administration.Total: USD 4,479,000Here is a summary of the budget, buffers, and final amounts to be requested (see notes):1374×498 69.9 KBBudget considerationsUSD costs are fixed, meaning that if the price of ARB increases, the USD costs will remain the same. At the end of the program, any remaining ARB tokens from the program will be returned to the treasury.Any remaining funds from the experimental incentive program multisig will sent back to the treasury.*Final amounts in ARB will be recalculated on the basis of the ARB price at the time of submitting the proposal for voting in Tally.The funds will be sent to the recently approved MSS.Management and development of the Delegate Incentives Program: Responsibilities and DeliverablesThe SEEDGov team and Karma will continue to collaborate to maintain and manage this new version of the DIP.Program Dashboard Management (Karma)Over the past six months, our team has successfully built and maintained the DAO’s compensation dashboard. Based on this experience, we anticipate the following work for the upcoming year:Infrastructure Maintenance and Expenses: We will continue to ensure that the dashboard operates smoothly, with real-time data updates for most metrics and daily overall calculations. This includes regular software maintenance, such as updating libraries and other necessary tasks to keep the system secure and efficient.Ongoing Collaboration with SEEDGov: Regular calls with the SEEDGov team over the past six months have been instrumental in maintaining the program’s smooth operation. These meetings have allowed us to address bugs, resolve data discrepancies, and implement enhancements based on administrative needs. We will continue these calls to ensure ongoing improvements in operational efficiency.Compensation Calculation Logic Updates: As outlined in the new proposal, we will implement necessary changes to the compensation calculation logic. This includes introducing a tier system, adjusting weights and metrics, and incorporating a 90-day calculation period.Automation of Voting Statistics: Our current system fully automates voting statistics, streamlining the process for admins to determine compensation. Collecting data on Communication Rationale and Proposal Feedback has historically been time-consuming. A few months ago, we introduced an MVP that automates this process using LLM tools. We plan to continue enhancing this feature to further assist administrators.Verification of Statistics: All statistics need to be verified for accuracy in a timely manner, specifically by the first of each month. We will continue to ensure that this verification process is completed on schedule to maintain the reliability of the data.Program Manager (SEEDGov)ResponsibilitiesIn the first iteration of the DIP, we encountered additional tasks that were not anticipated when drafting the proposal, which required extra effort to meet the program’s requirements. Therefore, in this new version, we have updated the responsibilities of the program administrator:Check corresponding data to see delegates’ eligibility.Collaborate with Arbitrum Foundation to ensure delegates complete the KYC/KYB process and perform the necessary follow-up.Constantly monitor delegates’ activity.Support delegates with any questions or concerns related to the incentive program through Telegram, forum, or Discord.Collect feedback from delegates and the community to improve the program.Review delegate comments in the forum and filter out spam messages.Communicate any changes in the incentive program to the delegatesPublish monthly results in the forum.Publish monthly program costs in the forum.Solve disputesDetermine which delegates receive Bonus Points.Collaborate with MSS to ensure payments to delegates are processed each month.Periodic review of the information uploaded to the Karma dashboard.Have weekly meetings with Karma to fix bugs and enhance the dashboard.Prepare periodic reports.Prepare a rubric and a monthly report about each delegate’s feedback performance.Monitor the participation of the delegates in the governance calls mentioned for the bonus points.DeliverablesWe commit to delivering:Monthly results of the DIP.Public cost reports to allow for audits by any interested party.Mid-term and final evaluation reports of the program.AdditionalsHold meetings with delegates to gather feedback on the program and provide them with updates.Constantly work on improvements to the program.What else can we do?We are committed to reaching out to each of the delegates who meet the requirements to be part of the program but are not yet enrolled. Our goal is to encourage everyone to join, helping to maintain and increase the diversity of voices in Arbitrum DAO.KPIsIn this new iteration of the DIP, we aim to establish the following KPIs:Achieve that 50 delegates receive incentives.Engage 100 delegates in the program.Achieve an average Total Participation (TP) of 80% among participants in the program within six months.Introduce improvements to the program after six months.Continuous UpgradesWe know that this program still has room for improvement. While this new program version moves away from its experimental nature to become a more developed one, a delegate incentive program must continuously receive feedback from its participants.The SEEDGov team and Karma are committed to gathering feedback, obtaining more information, and implementing the necessary changes to optimize performance. Considering the new duration of the program, the Program Administrator reserves the right to make changes in the scoring methodology by giving public notice in the forum.Note that everything related to DIP 1.0 that has not been mentioned as modifications in this new proposal will remain in effect in v1.5.TimelineSnapshot vote: September 19th, 2024 (ready)The options were sent to vote in Snapshot as follows:FOR, DIP V1.5 (chosen option)FOR, DIP V1.1ABSTAINAGAINSTTally vote: Starting on Thursday 10th October, 2024."

Simply put, the community has varying confidence that our current way of working can and should continue.This proposal would sign Disruption Joe and Alex Lumley to six-month exclusive full-time work for Arbitrum DAO.The total risk is the cost of paying them. The potential upside is the alleviation of critical problems. This proposal has the potential impact of increasing the throughput of successful DAO initiatives by an order of magnitude in 2025.MotivationThe primary motivation of this proposal is to develop a governance operations system that facilitates improved accountability & alignment.To be able to improve the confidence in our systems, we must understand the problems that are currently undermining our efforts.Delegates are telling us:They do not have a reliable way to quickly see the status of ongoing initiatives causing excess time spent trying to gain context on each of a growing number of initiatives.Many proposals do not specify specific goals or milestones making it difficult to understand if they are making progress.Most initiatives can not be understood in context to the overall priorities of the DAO .Many proposals did not account for all critical components needed to successfully execute, causing excess time figuring out how to alleviate preventable issues.Every initiative seems to be relearning many of the same operational lessons causing the DAO to spend time and resources redundantly.Builders are telling us:The DAO is moving too slowly causing them to lose faith in the ecosystem.The support available from Offchain Labs is different now that OCL is focused on Orbit and Stylus adoption causing them to be unsure of their commitment to Arbitrum OneThey are unsure the DAO’s intended outcomes making it hard to align their roadmap with DAO driven initiatives such as proper timing to utilize the Security Subsidy Fund.Contributors are telling us:It is very time-consuming to do the discovery to find out if delegates are interested in supporting a proposal causing them to question their participation in Arbitrum DAO.There isn’t any list of work to be done, desired outcomes, or even current areas of focus causing them to make proposals which feel like a “shot in the dark”.There isn’t a quick process to approve a small change to a passed proposal whether it be deliverable dates or the need for additional funds making it difficult to ensure success.There isn’t an open process for selecting priorities causing them to worry about vendor lock-in making their attempts to participate potentially futile.They are frustrated knowing that there is plenty of work to be done without a budget available to do the work of determining next steps.The DAO currently lacks confidence in its ability to provide throughput of quality work executing on the most impactful initiatives possible.# RationaleThis proposal has a relatively low cost and a very high potential impact. Both Disruption Joe and Alex Lumley have played key roles in passing earlier DAO proposals. This work requires high context individuals and builds on previous research from Blockscience, “Arbitrum Expert Service Provider Network Program Development” (commissioned by a Thank ARB firestarter grant).For six months, they will provide governance operations support including execution support, filling in gaps in proposals, and documenting the set of systems & processes used by the DAO. Beyond the deliverables listed in the specifications, they will commit to exclusively working with Arbitrum which may include participating in work groups, organizing and facilitating meetings, and being a point of contact for general DAO inquiries.RiskSmall RewardPotential RewardThe cost of funding two full-time contributors for six months or less if the DAO decides to cut it early.Clarity in the current initiatives intended outcomes, milestones, and progress. Saved delegate and contributor time. Allows for higher-impact proposals to be passed.The DAO unlocks the ability to pass a higher number of higher impact proposals at a higher rate creating an order of magnitude increase in overall impact. Arbitrum DAO stands out as a leader in organizational innovation.SpecificationsThis proposal should be evaluated on three levels (as all proposals should). These are output, outcomes, and impact.OutputOutcomeImpactHost Monthly Governance Reporting CallsDelegates find the Monthly GRC useful and improvingDelegates feel that this work is saving them timeConduct Monthly Confidence in the DAO SnapshotsAn increasing Confidence in the DAO scoreHigher trust and engagement in DAO governanceAct as counterparty to ongoing initiatives including weekly check-insContributors feel supportedIncreased contributor satisfaction and retentionFill in executional gaps in ongoing initiativesInitiatives remain on track and aligned with goalsGreater accountability and progress trackingConduct close out interviews with initiative leads to document learningsLearnings are documented and sharedEnhanced knowledge sharing within the DAODesign a communication rubric to quickly illustrate the status of initiativesIt is easy for delegates to assessImproved decision-making by delegatesAn outcome database is started to establish a hierarchy of outcomesAnyone can see the status of all outcomes the DAO is working towardsBetter strategic alignment of DAO effortsA proposal database links initiatives to the desired outcomesProposals are aligned with desired outcomesEfficient use of resources and targeted initiativesA governance operations wiki is made to document processes & playbooksGovernance processes are transparent and accessibleOperational efficiency and onboarding improvements# Steps to ImplementForum Discussion: 10/4-10/9Snapshot: 10/10-10/16Tally: 10/17 -MSS to send proportional payment for 10/15 - 11/1 and start linear token stream scheduled through the remainder.TimelineAs full-time contractors, our work would be towards solving the problems listed above and earning the right to work on more advanced ecosystem needs. Thus, we would be committing to fully executing the accountability phase. The alignment and throughput phases listed below are only intended to inform the direction of efforts if all accountability deliverables are met. We intend for the compensation to include a bonus structure which would reward work accomplished in the alignment and throughput phases.PhaseDescriptionKey DeliverablesAccountabilityWill execute and facilitate adoption of tools by 4/15/25.Conduct stakeholder engagementA regular cadence of meetings with initiative leads, design and implementation of structured reporting, and the creation of feedback loops via Monthly Governance Reporting Calls.Develop & maintain critical documentation & processesDevelop a suite of well-documented systems and processes to connect and make publicly available a well-organized repository of critical information.

This proposal requests to regirster a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change. The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes with the upgraded token, reduce user costs, and improve overall accessibility for RARI DAO.MotivationRARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. Only the Arbitrum DAO can however set up the mapping of L1 → L2 token addresses in the custom gateway (which is controlled by Arbitrum DAO) on the Arbitrum native bridge. Here is more information about the topic: ERC-20 token bridging | Arbitrum DocsRationaleThe RARI DAO multichain governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible, by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, and enabling new token functions. This aligns with Artbitrum’s commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.With a custom L2 token implementation we will be able to perform the RARI DAO governance upgrade and move our governance fully into the Arbitrum ecosystem.Key TermsRARI token: RARI DAO governance token ($1.94 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | EtherscanRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chainCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forwardSpecificationsRARI token in question ($1.94 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | Etherscan) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.As such, we’re requesting a custom L2 token implementation and using the (standard) custom gateway. Lacking the ability to upgrade / owner-register, we are seeking Artbirum DAO’s approval to register the upgraded RARI token to the custom gateway so we can proceed with the custom L2 implementation.The upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here: https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305.Token contract was deployed to Arbitrum Sepolia, RARI testnet (which is on top of Arbitrum Sepolia) and all contracts were tested manually as well.RARI DAO voted in favor of the upgraded token: Tally | Rari DAO | RRC 30 - Enhancing RARI DAO Governance: Plan for upgradeUpdate: the executable code to create the custom gateway was prepared by Offchain Labs and can be found HERE.The code was fully audited by Trail of Bits.

Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.Background and ProgressThe Arbitrum grants, administered via DDA by Questbook and 4 domain allocators, (Cattin, Adam, Juandi and JoJo) went live on the 5th of October with a total grants budget of $800k spread across four domains. Since the launch of the grants program, the Arbitrum domain allocators approved proposals requesting $912k and disbursed a total of ~$394,000 to accepted proposals from a pool of 201 proposals. These domain allocators were elected from the community and by the community. The specific information regarding the accepted proposals and the funded teams can be found here.As previously stated in our initial proposal, Questbook launched the grants program to further scale it based on proposal volume and learnings from the first ever grants program in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. The Arbitrum Grants run through DDA has received overwhelming response, receiving over 200+ proposals since launch.Please find below the Arbitrum DDA Grant Programs funding breakdown of relevant metrics and insights and proposed improvements going forward.Program OverviewTotal Proposals: 201Total Proposals approved: 60Proposals by domainGaming: 51New Protocol Ideas: 57Dev Tooling: 42Education, Community and events: 51Approved Proposals by domain (81/193 milestones completed)Gaming: 1618/44 Milestones CompleteNew Protocol Ideas: 158/49 Milestones CompleteDev Tooling: 1217/38 Milestones CompleteEducation, Community and events: 1538/62 Milestones CompleteGrant Amounts committed by domain ($) -

In order to avoid a price fluctuation like that, and based on the feedback received on the Questbook DDA program feedback call from the DAO and delegates, an option is to convert all the Arb received at the time of the proposal passing to Stable coins immediately, to avoid fluctuation.As many projects have not completed their milestones yet, and with the milestones not having a due date for completion, a problem we foresee is these funds if the projects do not complete them may be locked for ever, or for an indefinite amount of time. If the projects complete their proposals post the program time, there is no structure in place to have the DAs review them post completion and fund them, as the program would have ended by then. To avoid this, for the next program, fixed deadlines will be set for a grant, where either the proposal can be taken over by a seperate team, or the funds can be clawbacked and allocated to another proposal.Work hour restrictions for DAs was limiting their ability to maximise their impact on the program, as they were only allowed to deliver 60 hours of effort a month. Based on the program so far, we realise that a time restriction only inhibits the DA from their ability assess proposals and support them more deeply, and therefore are suggesting a fixed monthly pay for the work a DA and PM does instead of pay on an hourly basis.Some of the proposals or conversations projects had with Quesbtook could not be followed on with a funding due to the soft cap established on the program to start with. To tackle this issue, and with the Arbitrum foundation grant ranging from $50-250k, we believe the program should increase its cap to $50k to cover the gap and accept a wider number of proposals.While all feedbacks, changes and evaluation were timely reported in the Questbook platform, was nonetheless necessary for DA to engage with grantees through chatting systems like Telegram and Google meet. This has generated some questions from the community as a whole regarding inhomogeneous communications ways. We will address this by standardizing both the report frequency, the template used, and especially by setting up a shared discord between all domains. 1:1 calls between DAs and teams will still be needed.ProposalBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:DomainDomain AllocatorProposed BudgetNew Protocol IdeasJojo$920,000GamingAdam$920,000Dev ToolingJuandi$920,000Education, Growth, Community and EventsCattin (Seed Latam)$920,000RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domainNew Protocol Ideas - LinkGaming - LinkDev Tooling - LinkEducation, Growth, Community and Events - LinkWe propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected durationThe increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.Specifications and ImplementationSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1. Each domain allocator will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.While the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:have better accountability for the increased soft capdefine a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completeddefine a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.The DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DAin case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N*3.The disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.After the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.To ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.Arbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February.  If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.CompensationSourcing, reviewing, funding, marketing, tracking and nurturing proposals requires significant expertise and time commitment from the grants committee members and they should be fairly and competitively compensated for their efforts. Based on the learnings from the previous program specified above, we believe that opting for a fixed payment structure over an hourly paid model may be more impactful for the program. DAs and PMs have months where the work goes above and beyond the work hours mentioned, which does not get compensated accordingly, and there are constraints to work hours and impact a DA can provide within the limited hours provided. This indeed also impacted the turnaround time, alongside some technical difficulties.We propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.We are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.RoleMonthly CostTotalProgram Manager and Questbook$10000$60,000*Domain Allocator$8000$192,000Overhead for extra 6 months$8400$50,400Operations Cost, Misc.$10,000Totals:$312,400*Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM’s payment.As per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.We suggest that the grants committee continue with Synapse for KYC services and Docusign for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.KPIs and ExpectationsProgram SuccessIncrease in the number of contributors, proposals, and funded projectsIncrease in milestone and proposal completion ratesIncrease in NPS score from all proposers and granteesLower response turn around time to delegates’ and community’s queriesDiversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few.

In order to streamline the code auditing process and avoid potential time-consuming challenges, the domain allocators will provide assistance to the considered/accepted proposals by offering feedback on code quality and design.As an addition to the previous iteration, projects will have to submit a proposed timeline for their project. The maximum time to complete the final milestone will be 1 year from the start of this iteration of the program (equivalent of 6 months after the natural end of it); after this date, all undistributed funds related to grant that did not complete their milestones will be given back to the Arbitrum DAOThe DAs, alongside the PM, will publish every 45 days in the Arbitrum governance forum a comprehensive report of the current status of the approved applications.Every 2 weeks, the DAs will host a public office hour for protocols to come in and request information about any detail they might need to understand to apply to the grant program. This public call will also be used to provide general feedback on the ongoing program and will also let delegates and other stakeholders ask for information about itSimilar to the Arbitrum DDA program 1, the Program Manager will collaborate with the Arbitrum Foundation team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out necessary RFPs in order to ensure alignment with Arbitrum’s priorities and roadmap.About QuestbookQuestbook (YC-W21) is a decentralized grant orchestration tool, currently being/previously used by Polygon, AAVE, Celo, Solana, TON, Aleph Zero etc.Considering the achievements of Arbitrum DDA program, as well as the time commitment and operational expertise necessary for running an effective grants program, Questbook will continue in the role of the Program Manager. Srijith from Questbook will keep his role with the responsibilities of the Program Manager.Next StepsWe welcome the community members to participate in the temperature check and share their feedback and comments below.Temperature check on the proposal.

(what do we include/exclude? discuss current initiatives or only big-picture stuff e.g. strategy, org design? single track or multi-track? etc.)when should this happen?how long should it last?Who facilitates it?What’s the location (online/offline, which platform/venue)Budgetetc etc.Answering those questions will require engagement from the top delegates and project management work to take this from a loose idea to a refined proposal.So before we commit to discussing the details, this temperature check aims to confirm whether delegates believe:an Offsite proposal is something that should be exploredor we should shelve the idea, avoid wasting everyone’s time and focus on something else.IMPORTANTThis proposal is about polling whether top delegates are interested in the initiative. Unless we get the majority of top delegates voting that they will get involved in shaping this initiative, we’re dropping it.A vote in favour of this proposal does NOT mean an offsite should be executed. A vote in favour will NOT result in a Tally proposal being the next step. A vote in favour only means an offsite should be EXPLORED through conversations with top delegates and key stakeholders.If this proposal receives significant support from the majority of top delegates: we’ll have a series of calls (group and 1-1) with the delegates and launch a couple of polls to agree on the details of the Offsite. And only then, we’ll draft a proposal with the details."

I shared a timeline and summary of the experience on the Arbitrum Forum here:ArbitrumDAO's 'Biggest Minigrants Program Ever' Fiasco Summary Grants Discussions    I am sharing here on this forum as one of the contest winners in the ArbitrumDAO/ThankARB Jokerace contest initiated in late January of 2024. For those that are not familiar, this was an 8-week series with four winners each week. It was coined ‘Arbitrum’s Biggest Mini-Grant Series Ever’ with 32 winners, each winning 2500 ARB (equivalent of roughly $5k USD at the time). Each week, contest applicants and winners were highlighted on social media, and winners were excited about their winnings and …  Thrive Protocol’s team was able to collect the wallet addresses and payout dates of those that were a part of the grant series. These are those dates and # of projects:1 company (Feb 25th)12 companies (April 16th)8 companies (May 17th)2 companies (June 4th)4 companies (June 7th)4 companies (June 19th)1 company (Aug 1st)There were 19 projects that received their payouts in May and June. The original payout value was 2500 ARB, or during the contest window before Arbitrum’s 70% token unlock the equivalent of roughly $4,500-$5,700 USD. Due to the extensive delays and large drop in ARB value, many of us received significantly less. The drop in ARB value was not the only damage incurred. As can be read in the comments and testimonials, teams experienced other forms of damages including stress, loss of teammates, and downturns in team and community morale.I began to step into this grant round as an unpaid advocate in month 4, and tried to help organize the managing parties to send payouts. In this process I reached out and connected to as many of the 18 projects paid out in May or June that I could reach. Of those, 5 are still interested in executing, weren’t able to execute or partially execute, and are still interested and able to move forward now 9 months later from their orginal grant proposals where they were voted on as a winner.The request is for the losses incurred by the winners that received their payouts in time frames ranging from 3-7 months later after their week’s round closed. We have collected the following data below and have adjusted the price differential to a 2-week post-winning time period, which we believe is a fair payout timing for grantees, and embeds a normal currency fluctuation risk period taken on by grantees.I would also like to add $5,000 USD for myself as a community advocate for the last 6 months on this grant round, performing the following activities over many hours from:Organizing program managers from Arbitrum, Thrive Protocol, and Fractal into a Telegram group and with phone calls to help streamline communication and move the process alongSpeaking with numerous grantees in chats and calls over the last months while gathering data and working on my own projectGathering and presenting data to all groups in Telegram, this forum, and on an ArbitrumDAO call.Hopefully this data is helpful learning as Arbitrum is now updating their incentives processes. I had no plan of being paid. I am a diversity and financial inclusion-focused community leader in Web3, which is why for my focus it has been very important for the winners to have someone voicing their issues to the parties managing this grant, and advocating for them, in addition to myself.The following projects are all winners from the Minigrants round, are reachable, were paid out in May, June, and/or August, and are interested in executing their project as proposed and are ready to begin or continue immediately. This is the most detailed status update we could acheive together:please note, it is still unclear why some projects were paid twice as this grant round had a 1 time payout of 2500 ARBPROJECT 1: SI<3>Week 3 winner (Feb 2nd): 2500 ARB.

The four month delay negatively affected the other aspect of our grant winnings which included being able to offer scholarship opportunities to women in Web3 in Africa. We shared with a women in web3 community in Africa we had won this contest and would be able to offer 30 scholarships to their members, but due to the delays this was not able to be executed (5 were given instead of 30 through our applications). With the additional $2,597 USD we will be able to offer the remaining 25 scholarships and bring in women into the future of Web3 identity (the grant category we won first place in out of 30 projects).Commiting to share project status updates on Karma GAP: YesPROJECT 2: RadDreamsWeek 1 winner (January 19th): 2500 ARB.ARB value on Feb 2nd (two weeks after Jan 19th winning date = ($1.76 * 2500 ARB) = $4,400 USDPayouts:This project’s payment was never received as it was sent in August to an old wallet that he asked program managers to update on file as it was so many months later, but they never did so no funds were received.Total funds lost: $4,400Time delay to payout: 7 MONTHSProject Status Update:RadDream will be able to execute its project on ARB which includes adding the ability to auto-deploy NFT collections created and curated by these communities using nothing more than a bot.Commiting to share project status updates on Karma GAP: YesPROJECT 3: Everest MobilityWeek 8 winner (March 7th): 2500 ARB.

Not only did this happen, but also lost resourceful engineer whom we were to make initial payment to, via the grant at the time. We also experienced significant emotional/agility/moral down-trend that followed with the grant payment delay.

We have held our payout and with the additional funds will be able to execute our gaming experience with ARB in our West Africa region.Commiting to share project status updates on Karma GAP: YesTotal funds requested = $14,606 USD (5 grantees) + $5,000 USD (karakrysthal’s community management and advocacy fee for 6 months of program follow-on support) = $19,606 USD.To note, I have kept this proposal process as open for all grantees to be aware of as possible so as to not miss anyone. This included posting numerous times in our group Telegram chat, and DMing those that I saw had payouts in May, June and August. Many projects were unreachable or no longer building on ARB any more. Without having a system to backtrack every winners detailed payout as this needed to be confirmed by them personally in order to do this detailed status update, it can be estimated that on average $2.5k USD was lost by 32 projects due to the delays or roughly $80,000 USD.We are hopeful to demonstrate through our status updates the losses incurred, both financially and in the delays and disruption in execution. Our contest winners were not required to submit our projects on Karma GAP, but we are all commiting to do so as we are wanting to deliver value as in our grant proposals to both Arbitrum and our projects. We can also share updates here on this forum as we make progress.Thank you to this forum’s commenters that have left constructive feedback. We understand the complexities of managing projects with new tools and processes, as this is what we are also experiencing developing our projects. We align with the commenters here that support our perspective that extreme delays in payouts due to organizational bottlenecks should not burden those that have been selected through their own hard work and dedication to executing their projects as proposed.The goal of the post and proposal was for financial compensation for grantees, and also for open and shared learning to support the DAO in it’s evolution. As with any project, the best results come from alignment of goals and the right tools and processes to support them. For future rounds, an additional point of feedback and what I am seeing with some other grant operators is to partner with ecosystems and communities. This can be from ecosystems with vertical expertise (such as a Gaming DAO), or regional communities. This can support grantors in seeing greater long-term ROI, as the success of the grantees is also important to that vertical/community/region as a whole.It would also be helpful not to run a grant round in the future right before executing a large token unlock, as this should have been anticipated.Thank you."

All expenditures will follow The Arbitrum Foundation’s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals, as detailed in a high level manner here and here (these guidelines apply mainly for the Foundation Grant Program, however, it offers insight into what the Foundation looks at when giving strategic grants or establishing strategic partnerships). Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its upcoming annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.MotivationIn line with its mission as laid out in its bylaws, The Arbitrum Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.Agreements typically last for a few years with the intention to align a project’s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation’s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation’s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.ChallengesThe Arbitrum Foundation runs two funding programs:Arbitrum Foundation Grant ProgramStrategic Partnership’s ProgramBoth programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers (as of June 30, 2024)Jan 1 - Jun 30 2024Future Capital CommitmentsSpend1Signed Agreements2Pre-agreement OfferUSDARBUSDARBUSDDeFi & Fintech$4,211,9163,277,700$8,785,0001,842,500$89,000,000Gaming$6,691,3539,579,703$1,200,5006,510,000$13,900,000Infra Service Providers$28,181,12442,941,326$8,372,9880$5,585,000NFT$1,265,825377,900$1,300,00010,017,000$0Other 3$3,576,5821,235,343$2,054,525240,000$0Total$43,926,80057,411,972$21,713,01318,609,500$108,485,0001 Actual spend in the first half of 2024 including payments made in ARB converted to USD using the ARB spot price at the time of payment2 Numbers include both confidential and non-confidential grants. Details of non-confidential grantees are publicly available here.3 “Other” category includes items that fall outside the scope of Fintech & DeFi, Gaming, Infra Service Providers, and NFTsThe above table provides an overview of The Arbitrum Foundation’s outstanding capital commitments since inception, as of June 30th 2024. Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:Signed agreements. The Arbitrum Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.Pre-agreement offer. An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation must have adequate reserves immediately available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Arbitrum Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners at the same time. Also, the Foundation must be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.With the above in mind, The Arbitrum Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Arbitrum Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:Tight budget. Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. Making competitive offers requires a lot of capital that we have not been allocated relative to other Foundations.Vesting. The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.Capital lockup. All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. For example, we could run into a situation where a grantee has not yet hit their milestones, but we need to assume they will and hold the potential payout in reserve. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Arbitrum Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner’s protocol.Together, The Arbitrum Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Arbitrum Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.We believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.Proposed SolutionFunding Request: 250 million ARBIn light of the above mentioned challenges, we believe that there are several reasons why increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:High costs of pursuing partnerships. Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from the Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.Expanding Orbit Chains. Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities. Additionally we should note that sometimes part Orbit chain grants could be rebates on the revenue that they contribute to the Arbitrum DAO, creating a mismatch between the Arbitrum Foundation allocating resources and the DAO collecting chain fees.Gateway to DAO. The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Arbitrum Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front line enablers, The Arbitrum Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.Proven track record. The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the 2024 Biannual Progress Report and successful collaborations with industry leading projects. Additionally, The Arbitrum Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.We also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for the Arbitrum Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.With the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the Arbitrum DAO. The amount will solely focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARBNew agreements signed after approval of this proposalContractual commitments lasting 1 year or longerSome foreseeable capital-intensive areas include, but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as needed-basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.The Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, the Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.Our goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it’s to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements."

The ARB will be converted by the Arbitrum Foundation only when macroeconomic conditions improve and the total amount obtained is similar to or higher than the first iteration (which got $30 million). The goal of the STEP program is treasury diversification along with ecosystem growth for Real World Asset (RWA) protocols on Arbitrum.MotivationThis proposal kickstarts the next version of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program, which aims to grow the RWA ecosystem (many of the top protocols do not need grants so much as AUM for their product) while simultaneously diversifying our treasury into stable, liquid and yield-generating assets (the volatility of the ARB token has highlighted the need for prudent diversification based on fixed targets).The RWA sector is currently $12 billion (it was $1 billion at the time of STEP 1), growing at leaps and bounds with much room to grow even further considering the US treasury market by itself is $20 trillion. To stay on top of this competitive sector, we need reliability and consistency in the programs we run for this vertical.At the same time, we have seen increasing interest in treasury diversification initiatives across Arbitrum DAO. We propose 3 clear principles to follow in dealing with service providers proposing to help with Arbitrum treasury diversification;Directly own the process of selecting stable assets providing yield rather than delegating to a treasury manager (no point paying 1% AUM for them to hold low-risk assets on our behalf).The STEP program is an example of how this can take place: an RFP under which projects apply with their product; a committee to review applicants; a program manager to monitor selected productsDiversify the treasury in a manner that also promotes ecosystem growth, by conducting a competitive process where the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO selecting a providers asset is as valuable as the business they get from itAccordingly, have projects directly apply in a competitive process on our forum if they want us to diversify into their product and be ratified in some way through a vote, not privately approach a treasury manager to get includedUse fixed targets for conversion to obtain a better bang for our ARB and reject treasury managers proposing point-in-time diversification below the targetWe propose additional treasury diversification take place at a rate close to or higher than the first STEP program. Since we already have $30 million converted into stable RWAs, there is no urgency for more diversification at a significantly lower price.RationaleIn mid-2024, Arbitrum DAO diversified $30 million into stable, liquid & yield generating RWAs. A comprehensive RFP process was undertake, where the DAO received 33 applications from RWA issuers, of which 16 were shortlisted and 6 were finally selected for allocations: Securitize BUIDL ($9.57 million), Ondo USDY ($5.22 million), Superstate USTB ($5.22 million), Mountain USDM ($3.48 million), OpenEden TBill ($3.48 million), and Backed Finance bIB01 ($3.48 million). These allocations helped us diversify the treasury into dollar denominated assets, got selected providers to launch on Arbitrum and are expected to generate a yield of roughly $1-1.5 million per year for our treasury.While the 1st program narrowly targeted low-risk and liquid instruments (primarily US treasury bills and money market instruments), the second version will expand its scope to include products in private credit, equities, commodities and global bonds. We saw breakout interest from service providers with such products in the 1st version of STEP and had to turn down the majority of them due to a limited mandate. The dashboard at rwa.xyz lists these categories as fast-growing and we should be at the forefront of nurturing such products.Overall, this proposal aims to achieve 3 broad objectives;Show that Arbitrum has a plan for the RWA vertical and such projects should build on our chain, by expanding the STEP program to more categories than just U.S. treasuriesLet the DAO directly own stable RWAs through a competitive selection process for providers, instead of paying 1% AUM to treasury managers for selecting and holding low risk assets on our behalf. Use yield from the products to cover operational expenses.Provision funds ahead of time for optimal execution, so that the next STEP program is of a roughly similar value or higher than the last one ($30 million) at the same price tag, by waiting until the right macroeconomic conditions before liquidating the budgeted ARBSpecificationsWe will transfer 35 million ARB to the same foundation managed wallet (0xe41d54471EfA03eFF6365795f60545F3cAF7C97e) used in the initial STEP programThe foundation will at their discretion either set limit orders for ARB or liquidate after average ARB price over the last month is close to or higher than the amount received for the initial STEP programThe Arbitrum Foundation announces availability of funds on the forum after completion of orders, kickstarting the next phase of an RFP for RWA projects to apply under on the governance forumWhile funds are awaiting optimal execution or soon after, proposals are passed ratifying the RFP, committee composition for selection of providers, asset types, eligibility criteria for STEP 2 and other required details for running the programFunds are allocated to selected providers after ratification by the DAOSteps to ImplementThe focus of this proposal is ensuring we have sufficient time to optimally convert and receive adequate funds for the next STEP program, along with laying out some general guidelines for treasury diversification into stable assets (no AUM % fees on stable assets, focus on ecosystem growth in diversification, do not diversify when macroeconomic conditions are poor).Concurrently, the STEP steering committee (not involved in this proposal) is putting forth its own implementation budget to complete its research on STEP such as types of assets, eligibility criteria, liquidation methods, selection procedures and more. These deliverables will come into play after we are ready to run the next iteration of the program, upon successful conversion of the ARB into stables by the foundation, at a price similar to or higher than the last iteration of STEP.TimelineForum Discussion: SeptemberSnapshot vote: After first report from STEP 1 is releasedTally vote: After first yield from STEP 1 comes into our treasuryIndefinite : Waiting for optimal conditions before commencing diversification at a rate either higher than STEP 1 or not significantly below itOverall CostWork on this proposal has been funded by Thrivecoin’s ThankArbitrum Firestarter program, so there are no implementation costs baked into this proposal. The Steering Committee will separately put forth its own implementation budget for working on the necessary research into the STEP program.The only direct cost incurred with this proposal is the 35 million ARB to be converted by the Arbitrum Foundation at an opportune time to hold the next edition of the STEP program."

Thank you Arbitrum Proposals AppNon-ConstitutionalChallenge Statement:Right now, DAO delegates want to understand proposals efficiently and accurately, but proposal information is scattered all over the place (tweets, Discord servers, Telegram chats, discourse posts, offchain proposals [on snapshot], onchain proposals [on tally], etc.). This is a serious issue because it leads to unnecessary friction and inaccessibility in governance participation and, ultimately, poor decision-making for the Arbitrum DAO.Track Name at GovHack Brussels: GovTechTeam Number at GovHack Brussels: 16Members: andreiv.eth + paulofonseca.ethTeam Lead: Paulo Fonseca – @paulofonseca1987 on Telegram or @paulofonseca__ on Twitter2 minute Pitch: Posted on YoutubeLow Fidelity Design Prototype: (this is unfinished and in-progress work, since it was started during the GovHack itself) arbitrum.proposals.appAbstractTo fund the design and development of an Arbitrum-focused responsive web app that shows all Arbitrum proposals across different stages in their lifecycle and aggregates information from Discourse, Snapshot, and the Arbitrum Onchain Governor contracts so that voters and delegates can more efficiently and accurately understand the context and the whole lifecycle of each proposal they should be voting on.MotivationThe current governance state-of-the-art is quite messy. This is not just an Arbitrum DAO problem but it affects Arbitrum DAO governance quite a lot. Still to this day, most governance processes in most big DAOs are spread across multiple platforms and systems, from messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Twitter, to Discourse forums, to offchain voting platforms like Snapshot and then to onchain voting front-ends like Tally.In each of these platforms, delegates need to keep themselves up to date, review information about proposals coming to vote in the DAO and form their opinions about whether they should support a particular proposal. Delegates are also expected to actively share their concerns and provide feedback on proposals throughout the lifecycle of a proposal so that the proposal can advance through the several stages of the governance process successfully.For a delegate, even to the most competent ones, to keep up with all of this information scattered around different sources is… overwhelming, to say the least. As an example, this is roughly what happens when a delegate (or anybody else for that matter) tries to understand the context and form an opinion about an important Arbitrum proposal like the Gaming Catalyst Program that just recently passed.Full video can be seen here.If we expect more and better delegates to keep up with governance proposals adequately, we should invest in appropriate tooling to make their jobs much easier than they currently are.RationaleThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission and community values by making the Arbitrum DAO more innovative, open, accessible, and inclusive to delegates and voters by allowing them another choice as users of Arbitrum’s DAO governance.More specifically, the last community value in The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO, but to us, one of the most important community values, the one of attempting to be:Neutral and open: Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.We know Tally has a great partnership with the Arbitrum DAO, and we are grateful for all the work the Tally team has done over more than a year to support the governance of Arbitrum DAO. We support their developments and future roadmap and are open to collaborating in any way to improve the user experience of delegates and voters in their day-to-day.We also believe it is important for the Arbitrum DAO not to be vendor-locked in. More specifically, on the front end it offers its delegates and voters that allows them to participate in Arbitrum DAO’s onchain governance.We believe there should be multiple front-ends to Arbitrum DAO’s onchain governance, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them tools that suit their particular needs.We also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. For the obvious matters of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO on-chain governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue to participate in governance permissionlessly. proposals.app is fully open source and will continue to be. proposals.app and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time.SpecificationsHow might we enable DAO delegates, to get a more complete picture of how a proposal has evolved and what other people think about it, so that they can make a more informed voting decision, resulting in higher quality governance outcomes for the DAO?This guiding question and a bunch of conversations and user research with DAO Delegates both in GovHack and previously when we were building Senate, has led us to believe that there is a need for a unified view of a canonical DAO proposal page that covers the whole proposal lifecycle, or at the very least, from the “initial Discourse forum post” stage to the “onchain execution” stage, obviously including temperature check poll on Snapshot, and onchain voting.At proposals.app we already fetch Arbitrum’s DAO offchain and onchain proposals, and we also offer free email notifications to anybody that subscribes on the site. Everytime there is a new Arbitrum DAO proposal available, delegates and voters that have subscribed to proposals.app notifications, will get a fresh email in their inbox that looks like this.Currently, we are linking each offchain or onchain proposal to their respective Snapshot.org or Tally.xyz links so delegates and voters can easily exercise their governance rights.With this project we will build a Unified Proposal Lifecycle page, that merges the information of offchain and onchain votes for the same proposal, so that delegates and voters can have easier access to all of the information of a proposal in a single place.This Unified Proposal Lifecycle page will show information from the proposal’s Discourse post, from the Snapshot temperature check poll, and from the onchain vote.The challenge to be able to achieve this is to include all relevant information in the right way, at the right time, so delegates and voters don’t feel overwhelmed by it.We’ve been mapping the proposal elements across several platforms and feel confident we have a model that captures a proposal standard that is able to show the proposal lifecycle and how the proposal has evolved, and that will help delegates and voters get more transparency into the journey of a proposal and the context it’s current or final state.We will need to also manually map the discourse posts to the Snapshot polls and then to the onchain votes. Which is something that is not trivial to do for all past Arbitrum DAO’s proposals, but we will create a backoffice where a governance analyst can links all data sources of a proposal, to be shown in the Unified Proposal Lifecycle page.Steps to ImplementWe have a 2 part plan for this project:Design and Develop V1 of the Unified Proposal Lifecycle Page, which will include data and the mapping between Snapshot proposal data and Onchain proposal data.Design and Develop the V2 of the Unified Proposal Lifecycle Page that would add Discourse Post data.Alongside this main plan, we need to create a mechanism to map discourse posts to Snapshot polls and then to onchain votes, so that eventually that mapping doesn’t need to be done manually for every proposal.We are talking to @amanwithwings to move forward a daoURI standard in the Arbitrum DAO that could be extended so that Arbitrum DAO onchain proposals would include the link to their Discourse post in the onchain proposal metadata.Once that standard would be adopted by the Arbitrum DAO, we would be able to automate the mapping of data for a single proposal. Until then, we will do it manually and very deliberately. TimelineWe will deliver the complete solution described above within a maximum of four months of the project’s kick-off.The project kick-off is on October 15th, 2024, and we commit to deliver the completed project with all it’s Milestones and deliverables by February 14th, 2025.Milestone #1Deadline: 30 days after project kick-offDeliverables: Create the back-end discourse indexing system and mapping backoffice to map discourse data to snapshot and onchain proposals + Setup of self-hosted infrastructure with a real-time status page monitoringMilestone #2Deadline: 60 days after project kick-off, 30 days after Milestone #1Deliverables: Interactive Design Prototype DeliverableMilestone #3Deadline: 90 days after project kick-off, 30 days after Milestone #2Deliverables: Development of a responsive Unified Proposal Lifecycle webpageMilestone #4Deadline: 120 days after project kick-off, 30 days after Milestone #3Deliverables: Testing, Quality Assurance and Data Validation of all past proposals dataAfter completing the project, we commit to maintaining and ensuring the resilient hosting of the web app for at least 24 months from the project kick-off date.Overall CostThe overall cost for this 4 month long project totals $43,000 USDMonthly AmountDurationTotal AmountDesigner$5,000 USD3 months$15,000 USDDeveloper$5,000 USD3 months$15,000 USDGovernance Analyst$1,000 USD1 month$1,000 USDServers and Hosting$500 USD24 months$12,000 USDDuring these four months, we will ship 4 deliverables, the first at Milestone #1 at the 30 day mark, the second at Milestone #2 at the 60 day mark, the third at Milestone #3 at the 90 day mark and the fourth at Milestone #4 at the 120 day mark.The kick-off stage marks the beginning of the project after a successful acceptance of the questbook grant.We believe in performance-based compensation, so we will only be compensated upon value delivery after successfully delivering each of the Milestones.Payment scheduleKick-offMilestone #1Milestone #2Milestone #3Milestone #4DeadlineDay 1Day 30Day 60Day 90Day 120Payment$0 USD$10,000 USD$15,000 USD$15,000 USD$3,000 USDFor the multisig, we will use a Gnosis Safe multisig on Arbitrum One which has andreiv.eth and paulofonseca.eth as signers.

The STIP Backfund proposal was introduced to fund all the STIP applications that were approved but were not funded because the budget ran out. The distribution for STIP and Backfund incentives was extended to March 2024, while the Long Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP) was introduced in December 2023 and was poised to run from January 2024 to April 2024. Lastly, we had the STIP-Bridge proposal that was meant to mitigate the ‘unfair’ advantage that protocols distributing incentives from LTIPP would have over those distributing incentives from STIP & Backfund after the latter programs had expired.Anyone who followed the discussions around the different proposals and programs is familiar with the fact that time constraints played a significant role in why we didn’t stop to analyze the data collected and iterate based on that. We needed to maintain momentum and remain competitive with other L2s, especially while the market was overall bullish.Things have changed over the past few months, and the need for an incentive program that accounts for all the data that we have collected through the past programs has become apparent. Our proposal is a social agreement (we will post a temperature check vote on Snapshot but there will be no on-chain proposal) to use the 3 months following the conclusion of LTIPP and STIP Bridge explicitly to reflect on the learnings, to design & refine a program based on them, as well as on the feedback of key stakeholders.We know incentives are a vital part of protocol and ecosystem growth in crypto, and we want to help create a perpetual program that leverages incentives in the most efficient way to create the biggest positive impact on the protocols receiving them.RationaleThere are already hundreds of data points to review, analyze, and ultimately distill into actionable insights on what works and what doesn’t in terms of incentives. From professionally carried out analysis to opinion-article style posts in the forums from stakeholders close to the DAO and the incentive programs themselves, here is a non-exhaustive list of information to use (in chronological order):Proposal to Improve Future Incentive ProgramsDiscussion: Reframing Incentives on ArbitrumSerious People: Proposed KPIs for Arbitrum Grant Programs (LTIPP)A New Thesis for Network-Level Incentives ProgramsLearnings from STIP: Community Interview Summaries and NotesSTIP Analysis (ARDC Research Deliverables)OpenBlock’s STIP Incentive Efficacy Analysis[RFC] Thoughts on the End-Game Perpetual Incentives ProgramSTIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables)Memories of a (grantor) cow: thoughts about incentives program and what could be nextResearch Bounty Selections (to be completed)- Edit (2/10): Lampros DAO Published their report.The ARC’s vision on historical incentive programs and its futureBefore we embark on another incentive program, we should make an effort to incorporate the culmination of all the learnings from the above posts (and others I might have missed) into the design process.SpecificationsThe proposal will be submitted to Snapshot a week after this post is published on the forum. If it successfully passes temp-check, the proposed 3-month break from incentive programs will begin on September 17th, given that LTIPP and STIP Bridge incentive distribution timeframe conclude on September 2nd and September 16th respectively.Within 2 weeks of a successful temp-check, we will facilitate the revival of the incentives working group and invite delegates, researchers who have conducted analysis, protocol builders, and other relevant stakeholders to participate in the working group.L2BEAT does not wish to lead the working group, and we’d instead prefer to facilitate its creation and then step back and participate in it as delegates by providing our feedback and opinions. We do commit, however, to remaining active in the working group and helping drive the discussion forward.Once the working group has been formed, it should regularly meet and work towards designing an incentive program that accounts for as many of the insights we’ve gathered as possible without sacrificing operational efficiency and introducing too many complicated and unnecessary structures.Steps to implementThis RFC collects feedback and goes to Snapshot.The proposal passes Snapshot successfully.We ‘revive’ the incentives working group and invite all relevant stakeholders to participate.We collectively start designing and refining a long-term incentives program based on all the data we’ve gathered.On September 17th, the 3-month incentives break period begins.Ideally, by the conclusion of the 3-months break, we will be able to transform the design into an actionable program that can be submitted to the DAO as a proposal.[Optional] If 6 doesn’t happen from the working group itself, then we should at least create an overview of principles any future incentive program must take into account in order to be considered by the DAO.TimelineThe proposed timeline for the incentives detox is 3 months. If involved parties feel that more time is needed to design an incentive program that is as comprehensive as possible, then the timeline can be extended as needed without an additional vote.Overall CostThere is no cost associated with the execution of this AIP."

Executive SummaryBackgroundThe Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (”ADPC”), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is coming to the end of its first phase on August 20, 2024. As such, this proposal aims to extend the ADPC’s tenure into Phase II for a 6-month period, which will commence on the date on which the Tally vote for this proposal is executed on-chain.OutcomeThe ADPC’s pilot phase proceeded successfully, with significant outcomes to Arbitrum DAO and a range of key learnings for the committee. Creating a comprehensive procurement process from the ground up to ensure that Arbitrum is seen as a leader not only in the technical sphere but also within decentralized governance has been a great opportunity.We laid the foundation for the ADPC to be an effective set-up bringing the benefits of well-structured procurement to Arbitrum DAO. Cost savings will result from the creation and use of procurement frameworks and marketplaces developed by the ADPC uniquely for Arbitrum DAO as well as the necessary legal and operational infrastructure and strategic sourcing methodology.Way AheadThe ADPC’s initial phase was conducted as a proof of concept demonstrating the capability of the team and the benefits arising from the strategic use of advanced sourcing methodology. The ADPC proposes to build on these successes into Phase II of the ADPC’s engagement. In this Phase II, the ADPC, after careful alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO, proposes to work on all of the following work packages:Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 tactical verticalsVertical 1 will be focused on procuring RPC providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on engagement with delegates and stakeholders as well as an understanding of the core services required by all projects looking to build in the Arbitrum ecosystem.Vertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal. Please note that the ADPC will not request any funding for its events services procurement in that separate proposal.The scope within the 6-month term is to develop evaluation criteria, draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP/tender), evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s. Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in the scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those internal legal processes.Further details on our process for arriving at these shortlisted verticals can be found below in the section on Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II.Work Package 2: Continued management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services and, based on the success of the first cohort, publishing the proposal for an extension of the fund.Work Package 3Definition and creation of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget for the Arbitrum DAO, to be custodied by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS), and allocated towards the utilisation of service providers as whitelisted by the ADPC. This creates a utilisation rail for the DAO to be able to utilise the services of the whitelisted service providers procured by the ADPC. Without this in place, the DAO is unable to utilise these service providers without the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain).The ADPC will draft and propose the OpEx proposal to the DAO;  further details, including the process and procedure for utilization of the OpEx budget by the DAO, will be outlined in this separate proposal to the DAO. This seperate proposal will contain multiple options for the size of the OpEx budget for the community to vote on.Work Package 4Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have published for Phase I, and submitting it to the DAO.Continued alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).Ad-hoc tasks, e.g., aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.Optional Additional Verticals: On completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to [2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.The overall budget for the 6-month term will be USD 414,000 including OpEx, details on which can be found below in the Budget & Methodology section. The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 954,608 ARB based on the time weighted average ARB price of $0.5204/ARB as further outlined below. A buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC multi-sig under the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) is still able to satisfy payments to the ADPC’s members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury.The multi-sig requested to manage the funds is within the Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS) established by Entropy Advisors. The Multi-Sig that has been created by the MSS is the following address:arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0After receipt of the ARB, the ADPC will convert as much of the requested amount as is required to obtain 414,000 USDC and will return the unutilized ARB to the DAO treasury. This is intended to avoid fluctuations in ARB price and ensures that the ADPC avoids using the buffer as much as possible.The ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Gauntlet’s Aera solution to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor on-chain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modelling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.Once the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.Further details about the ARB conversion strategy and about Aera can be found below in the ‘ARB Conversion Strategy’ section below.Note: The proposal includes the re-election of the current members of the ADPC. For any future extension terms of the ADPC, the process outlined in the original Tally vote will stand unless automatic renewal of the then-current members is proposed. Of course, this will be subject to the potential OpCo that gets formed and any implications that may have on the structure of the ADPC.AcknowledgementsWe would like to acknowledge the consistent participation and deep input from the Arbitrum community, delegates, and stakeholders, without whom our progress would not have been possible. We would especially like to thank the security service providers who deeply engaged with the program from the very beginning. We would also like to thank all respondents to the ADPC’s outreach in determining the procurement frameworks to tackle in Phase II, including @bobbay, @JoJo, @Frisson, @realdumbird, @IronBoots, and @krst, among others.II. Background of the ADPCThe ADPC was established as a crucial component of the Arbitrum ecosystem’s governance structure, following a successful proposal and subsequent community vote in early 2024. The formation of the ADPC was driven by the growing need for a structured, transparent, and efficient approach to procurement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the ecosystem’s growth, security, and sustainability.The inception of the ADPC can be traced back to discussions within the Arbitrum community about the challenges faced by projects building on the protocol, particularly in securing high-quality service providers. These discussions highlighted the need for a pre-emptive quality assurance mechanism that could benefit the entire ecosystem. Against the background that a dedicated procurement framework has, to our knowledge, not been established in any DAO prior, the committee’s formation marked a pivotal moment not only in Arbitrum’s governance evolution, but set a precedent for DAOs in general. We designed the ADPC to address immediate needs and to create a foundation for future growth and efficiency in the ecosystem.Phase I of the ADPC ran for a duration of 182 days from February 21, 2024 (i.e., the day that the KYB for the ADPC members was completed) until August 20, 2024.The ADPC’s mandate in Phase I consisted of the following:A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers FrameworkOversee and facilitate the Procurement Framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.B. Subsidy Fund Research & ProposalResearch and draft a proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services to subsidize the costs for security services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.C. Development of Eligibility Framework (’Means Test’)Research and implement a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized  to assess a project’s eligibility for the subsidy fund referred to in paragraph [B] above.D. Establishment of Future Procurement FrameworksEstablish procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service types that the Arbitrum DAO could need in the foreseeable future.E. Creation and Communication of GuidanceCreate and communicate guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time.III. Achievements & ProgressThe ADPC made significant progress against its mandates:A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers FrameworkThe ADPC finalized and published extensive RFP documentation for whitelisting security service providers on June 19, 2024. This comprehensive framework is designed to establish a marketplace for whitelisted service providers to offer services pursuant to pre-agreed terms, conditions, and pricing to projects that have been granted subsidies under the Security Services Subsidy Fund Proposal.The development of the RFP documentation was an intensive, multi-stage process that involved various stakeholders and multiple rounds of refinement. The key stages included:Creating an initial draft that incorporated research on best practices in procurement frameworks and multiple internal drafting sessions;Working with DeDaub to integrate specific technical requirements into the RFP;Working with the Arbitrum Foundation’s legal team to align the legal documents with the Foundation’s policies and guidelines;Conducting a final review by the ADPC, DeDaub, and the Arbitrum Foundation;Publishing the final documentation.This procurement framework, being the first of its kind, set a new standard for procurement processes in the crypto space.The RFP received responses from 12 security service providers and the whitelisting of these providers is still in progress. We expect to execute the agreements necessary for enabling engagement in September 2024.B. Subsidy Fund Research & ProposalThe ADPC researched, drafted, and passed a proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services; the development of the proposal was strongly influenced by community engagement, while the terms and conditions for the receipt of the subsidy (’Means Test’) were mainly based on our experience from traditional procurement processes.The initial Subsidy Fund proposal incorporated:A comprehensive benchmarking exercise with 10 leading security audit service providers which was conducted to analyze costs and scope of typical security audits to determine the fund size and allocation;A detailed evaluation framework with weighted criteria for the ‘Means Test’; andTimelines and procedures for application submission and review.Following the publication of the initial proposal, the ADPC engaged in extensive community discussions. Key points of feedback included concerns about the large fund size and potential for inefficient capital allocation and questions about the capacity to manage such a large fund.In response to community feedback, the ADPC revised the proposal. In particular, the subsidy fund was reduced to $2.5 million worth of ARB (75% reduction) to potentially fund up to 12 projects for one cohort of 8 weeks and with a maximum subsidy per project of $250K (10% of the total fund).The ADPC also listened to and incorporated community feedback about the ADPC managing the initial subsidy fund itself. As a consequence, the ADPC translated raised community concerns into a concrete governance proposal to create a separate “Security Services Subsidy Fund Sub-Committee”, consisting of five members elected through a weighted voting system with a proposed compensation of 60,000 ARB in total. However, after thorough discussion, the community voted against the creation of the sub-committee, leaving the disbursement of funds under the subsidy fund to the ADPC.C. Development of Eligibility Framework (’Means Test’)The Means Test and the related Grant Application T&Cs were uniquely developed for Arbitrum DAO as a structured approach to evaluate applications for financial assistance. The primary goal of the Means Test is to identify applicants who would benefit most from support with the potential for significant positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem while (i) ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem and (ii) preventing exploitation by larger players.For this assessment, we:Developed a scoring system with a 1-5 rating scale and assigned weights to criteria based on importance.Developed four main criteria categories, each with weighted sub-criteria: Arbitrum Ecosystem Contribution, Business Model & Need for the Subsidy, Financial Analysis and a Risk Analysis.Based on community feedback, we further identified key verticals that are particularly valuable to the Arbitrum ecosystem.Implemented a two-stage evaluation process, with an initial screening focused on the five highest-weighted sub-criteria before conducting an in-depth review with a comprehensive evaluation of all criteria for top-scoring applicants.D. Establishment of Future Procurement FrameworksWhile our primary efforts were focused, due to the complexity of the undertaking and the high level of community engagement and input, on the oversight of the security-oriented service providers framework, the research and proposal of the subsidy fund, the development of the eligibility framework (‘Means Test’) and the creation and communication of guidance, we did conduct work to identify and prioritize potential verticals for future procurement frameworks. Our approach was to create a comprehensive and adaptable methodology that could be applied to various service categories, ensuring that future frameworks would be developed with a robust approach.More detail about our exploration into future procurement frameworks can be found in the section on Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II below.E. Creation and Communication of GuidanceThe ADPC achieved its goal of keeping the community abreast of its activities and progress during the entirety of its first phase by:Setting up a bi-weekly 1 hour call on the Arbitrum governance calendar to engage with delegates and community members;Establishing a dedicated dashboard including the Meeting Minutes of each week’s internal ADPC standing meeting and the ADPC’s current task list;Creating a dedicated Telegram channel to communicate with RFP applicants;Scheduling two AMA sessions to field and answer queries from RFP applicants; andPublishing a forum post explaining how the entire Procurement Framework operates.IV. Key Learnings & Improvements from Phase IA comprehensive set of learnings and recommendations can be found in the ADPC’s Phase I Outcome Report. A subset of the most important of these learnings that we will implement in Phase II are:Financial Management & BudgetingGiven the nature of this initial phase being a pilot, the budget for Phase I was more ‘experimental’, and thus did not fully account for all necessary resources. As such, this proposal will include a comprehensive budget plan and management that:Creates a fit-for-purpose budget model based on data collected during Phase I; this model is further explained in the Budget & Methodology section below;Bakes in Operating Expenses to account for unexpected challenges and opportunities;Allocates budget for specialized external consultants to address complex issues efficiently (such as DeDaub in Phase I); andIncreases the number of FTE personnel to adequately cover all aspects of the ADPC’s mandate.Clear Alignment with Arbitrum FoundationTo improve effective coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation, in Phase II we will:Designate specific points of contact within both the ADPC and the Arbitrum Foundation for different areas of collaboration (e.g., legal, technical, strategic). As needed, the points of contact will be with the DAO Relations team;Establish regular check-in meetings between the ADPC and Arbitrum Foundation;Implement a clear escalation path for urgent matters or deadlocks;Develop a mechanism for early Foundation review of legal frameworks;Coordinate timelines for legal reviews and feedback.Create a Long-Term Vision for the ADPC’s Role in Supporting ArbitrumAs can be seen in the Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II section below, we have already begun to identify a  list of selected procurement frameworks the ADPC can tackle over its next and future phases. To compile this list, we used a comprehensive methodology, involving community feedback and engagement, and took into account current market conditions and need for Arbitrum.In Phase II, we will further outline the ADPC’s role in the continued growth of Arbitrum and ensure that it forms an important part of the DAO’s structure going forward, including as a key component of the OpCo.Community Engagement & TransparencyWhile we spent significant time and resources on community engagement and providing regular, detailed updates, this part of our mandate was more time-consuming than anticipated but crucial for the success of initiatives. Key learnings that we will implement in Phase II are to:Implement a clear process for incorporating community input into decision-making;Improve the public dashboard to inform better about the ADPC and showing even more information on real-time progress;Develop comprehensive onboarding materials for community members interested in ADPC activities.V. Phase II MandateThe ADPC proposes the following work packages in Phase II:Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 Tactical VerticalsVertical 1. Procuring RPC ProvidersVertical 1 will be focused on creating a whitelisted panel of RPC providers that can be procured by projects currently building or looking to build on Arbitrum. This panel of RPC providers will enable streamlined access and transparent pricing during the project’s build phase or post-launch, adding to the ecosystem of support services for Arbitrum projects and Orbit chains.We have chosen this vertical based on discussions with key delegates and stakeholders, given that a key focus for Arbitrum is to grow the Orbit ecosystem, while RPC costs are relatively high and RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits. Moreover, the technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a huge time suck for projects. Pre-vetting RPC providers would make it much more attractive for projects to build on Arbitrum.In case there is any major opposition to the selection of this vertical, the ADPC will in the first month of Phase II engage with key delegates and stakeholders to arrive at a final decision on the vertical to tackle. The stakeholders we have engaged with have demonstrated an interest in each of the verticals listed below. To find such a substitute vertical, we will:Shortlist key stakeholders to schedule calls with;Liaise with the Arbitrum Foundation to identify relevant legal and regulatory considerations associated with these frameworks;Create engagement surveys to be shared with key delegates and projects building on Arbitrum to identify their one prioritized vertical from the below four verticals:VerticalDescriptionNeedDevRel FirmsThe procurement of DevRel firms consists of two categories: (1) procuring online content producers that can get Arbitrum mentioned in developer resources, and (2) procuring consultancy shops and dedicated teams for Arbitrum to educate developers and projects about Arbitrum technology and help them build on Arbitrum.After discussions with the Arbitrum Foundation, we realized that there is a lack of concentrated DevRel support from the DAO to disseminate the benefits of Arbitrum tech like Stylus to existing and potential new projects. Improving Arbitrum’s reach in developer resources can help onboard more developers into the ecosystem, while dedicated teams can better help projects looking to build on Arbitrum (e.g., game developers funded via GCP).OTC ServicesCreating a whitelisted panel of OTC desks via which projects and contributors on Arbitrum (incl. the AF) can safely liquidate their ARB or other assets without causing an impact on the price. Users can submit quotes via a front-end, which can then be routed to all OTC desks, with the best price being chosen.The current ARB liquidation process leads to many projects and grant recipients liquidating ARB themselves which leads to dilutive effects on ARB price, and there is no set way of liquidating ARB. The price impact of swapping ARB is high, and having a panel of whitelisted OTC desks and a streamlined method of liquidating ARB across the DAO is critical.Tokenomics & Token Launch TeamsCreating a whitelisted panel of tokenomics and token launch teams that projects building on Arbitrum can tap into, enabling streamlined access and transparent pricing during the project’s build phase or post-launch, adding to the ecosystem of support services for Arbitrum projects and Orbit chains.Tokenomics and token launches are extremely nuanced and difficult aspects for crypto projects to get right, and there are not a lot of ‘top’ teams that can help projects create fit-for-purpose, sustainable tokenomics. Having a whitelisted set of service providers would incentivize projects to build on Arbitrum. Moreover, existing initiatives like GCP will be able to make it more attractive to build on Arbitrum with such a service and any initiatives focused on enabling building on Arbitrum benefit from tokenomics and token launch support.Risk Service ProvidersCreating a whitelisted panel of risk service providers that projects building on Arbitrum and DAO proposals and initiatives can tap into, enabling streamlined access and transparent pricing for both sets of stakeholders (Arbitrum projects and the DAO).As Arbitrum is the Home of DeFi and a lot of protocols will require access to risk service providers to assess asset and other types of risks, having a panel of whitelisted risk providers is a net benefit for projects. Moreover, in its role in the ARDC, Chaos Labs did a lot of work to assess the base fee increase and other risk assessments for DAO proposals that proved very informative for the DAO to make a decision. Procuring from a panel of providers ensures a better deal for the DAO and is important for a myriad of proposals.For further information on the methodology we used to shortlist these frameworks, see the Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II section below.Vertical 2. Procuring Events ProvidersVertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal.The selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC, Entropy Advisors will first create an events & sponsorships strategy while, in parallel, event providers will be whitelisted. Second, individual RFP processes will be conducted to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel.Please refer to the “RFP - Establishing a DAO Events Strategy for 2025” proposal for granular detail on how this procurement process will be constructed when it is published in the coming weeks.Scope for Work Package 1The scope within the 6-month term is to:Develop evaluation criteria;Draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP / tender);Evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s.If need be, research and begin the process of setting up a subsidy fund for the RPC providers vertical (or, if the need arises, a substitute vertical chosen by the DAO). This will include the development and ratification of the Means Test for that specific fund, community engagement and research to determine the size of the fund, drafting a proposal to pass the fund through Arbitrum governance, and if need be, the set-up of a separate sub-committee to manage the fund.For the Events vertical, conduct individual RFP processes to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel.Note:Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those external parties.To streamline our financial budget, the management of any subsidy fund other than the legacy subsidy fund for security service providers is not included in this scope. The management of newly formed subsidy funds could be conducted either by a separate sub-committee or by the ADPC (as decided upon by the DAO), and will be subject to an additional management fee which will be included in any extension proposal.Work Package 2: Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security ServicesScope for Work Package 2The management of the Security Services Subsidy Fund was not part of the ADPC’s mandate in Phase I. However, as decided by the DAO, the ADPC was elected to manage the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund, which we hereby include in the scope for this work package.Communication of key learnings and improvements from the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund.The ADPC will conduct in particular the following tasks to manage the Subsidy Fund (non-exhaustive):Setting up the infrastructure for running the program;Defining and executing the marketing strategy;Scanning inbound applications, filtering for scams/junk, and reviewing each application;Onboarding of grantees, including a welcome email with acceptance, set up of comms channels, coordinating KYB/KYC, etc.Setting milestones for funding and progress;Ensuring milestone alignment with program objectives;Setting clear project deliverables;Tracking progress;Executing funding alongside the Arbitrum Foundation;Preparing the End-of-Program report;Act as the point of contact and ‘customer service’ for all grant applicants.Depending on the success of this first iteration, market conditions, and demand from the DAO, the ADPC may propose an extension of the fund for one or more cohorts.Depending on discussions with the community and delegates and learnings from the first iteration of the fund, the ADPC will either propose a separate sub-committee to manage the fund or will propose to manage the next iteration of the fund itself. Both of these options will require additional fund management costs which will be included in any Subsidy Fund extension proposal.Work Package 3: Creation of OpEx (Operational Expense) Budget for the DAO to Utilize Whitelisted Service ProvidersObjectiveThe Arbitrum DAO currently faces significant inefficiencies in its ability to engage with service providers, particularly those whitelisted by the ADPC. Presently, any effort to solicit services, such as a security audit, requires the DAO to navigate the entire governance proposal life cycle — a process that can extend over a month for just a single deliverable. This protracted timeline not only delays critical operations but also impedes the DAO’s ability to respond swiftly to emerging needs, creating a bottleneck that hinders operational efficiency.To address these inefficiencies and better equip the DAO for future needs, we will propose the establishment of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget. This budget is designed to streamline the DAO’s interaction with ADPC-whitelisted service providers by creating a direct utilization rail. This rail will allow DAO initiatives and contributors to access and utilize these pre-approved service providers without undergoing the cumbersome proposal process for each engagement. The OpEx budget essentially bypasses the bureaucratic hurdles that currently plague the DAO’s procurement process, enabling a more agile and responsive operational framework.The OpEx budget will be initially administered by the Multi-Signature Service (MSS), ensuring that funds are allocated specifically for the utilization of ADPC-whitelisted service providers. The ADPC will draft the initial proposal for the OpEx budget, which will include detailed guidelines on its usage. Importantly, while the ADPC will establish the budget, it will not have control over its management or the approval of expenditures, thus maintaining a clear separation of duties and preserving DAO oversight.Why is an OpEx Budget Needed?Currently, the DAO’s engagement with service providers is hampered by a rigid and time-consuming process that involves submitting a governance proposal, conducting a Snapshot temperature check, and finally, holding an on-chain vote. This multi-step process is not only inefficient but also stifles the DAO’s ability to procure services in a timely manner, particularly in scenarios requiring quick action. By introducing an OpEx budget, we aim to eliminate these bureaucratic barriers, creating a streamlined pathway for the DAO to access necessary services from ADPC-whitelisted providers.Moreover, the OpEx budget is not just a temporary fix; it is a strategic initiative designed to future-proof the DAO’s operations. As the DAO evolves, the OpEx budget can be seamlessly integrated into future organizational structures, such as the prospective OpCo, which has been under discussion. By establishing this budget now, the DAO ensures it has a ready-made, adaptable infrastructure in place to meet its future operational needs. This forward-thinking approach not only addresses current inefficiencies but also lays the foundation for a more resilient and responsive organizational framework.Key Aspects of the ProposalFunding Allocation: The amount allocated to the OpEx budget will be determined through a governance vote, with the ADPC providing multiple options for consideration. The funds will be held in the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) set up by Entropy Advisors, dedicated exclusively to services procured through the ADPC’s whitelisted providers.Effective Utilization: The proposal will outline the procedures for the DAO to efficiently utilize the OpEx budget, ensuring that all expenditures are subject to appropriate oversight while still allowing for the flexibility needed to address immediate operational needs.Benefits of the ProposalImmediate Access: The OpEx budget will enable the Arbitrum DAO to quickly and efficiently engage with service providers without the delays imposed by the current governance process.Foundation for Future Operations: This initiative serves as a foundational step toward future-proofing the DAO’s operations. By establishing relationships with service providers now, the DAO will be better positioned to transition into more complex organizational structures in the future, with an established operational framework already in place.In summary, the introduction of an OpEx budget addresses the current inefficiencies in the DAO’s procurement process by providing a streamlined mechanism for engaging with service providers. It also future-proofs the DAO by laying the groundwork for its evolving operational needs, ensuring that the DAO can continue to operate efficiently and effectively as it grows and adapts.Work Package 4: Outcome Report, Definition of ADPC Vision and Role, and Ad-Hoc TasksScope for Work Package 4Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have published for Phase I, to be submitted to the DAO. The Outcome Report will consist of:Achievements and Progress from Phase II;Financial Overview;Overview of Community Engagement;Challenges;Key Learnings & Recommendations;Outlook.Continued definition of ADPC vision and role in the DAO:The DAO is currently in the process of determining its ways of working and operational structure for the short and long-terms. There have been extensive discussions among key delegates and community members around the set-up of an OpCo, and Areta has (tentatively) defined how the ADPC could fit into such a structure in the final report for the M&A Pilot Phase.As such, as part of the ADPC, we commit to continually align with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits cleanly into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).Executing on ad-hoc tasks such as aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.Optional Additional Verticals: Procurement for Up to [2] Additional Verticals Depending on the Completion of Work Package 1Scope of Optional Additional VerticalsOn completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to [2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval and approved by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.We are leaving some flexibility in this Work Package given the pace of change in the DAO and the broader crypto market, and recognize that the DAO’s needs and wants will likely change over time.Note: This work package will likely be subject to the ADPC requiring additional funding since this Phase II proposal is based on conducting procurement for two verticals. If the need for additional funding to conduct procurement for these further verticalsarises, the ADPC will approach the DAO with further details about budget and scope.VI. Budget & MethodologyBudget ComponentsPhase II BudgetAs outlined in the Phase I Outcome Report and the section on Key Learnings & Improvements from Phase I above, the actual work in the ADPC was significantly more time intensive than priced-in, but taken on by the committee as goodwill in the pilot phase. Since we have now left the pilot phase and will provide procurement services for two verticals in Work Package 1, the budget naturally reflects this.The ADPC is budgeting USD 360,000 for the work in Phase II as outlined in the Phase II Mandate section above.In Phase II, the ADPC will continue with producing the agreed outputs together with a continuation of management of all legacy programs including the management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Service Providers.Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services [Work Package 2]Regarding the Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services [Work Package 2], given the operational effort to set up and run such a fund, as described in Work Package 2 above, we would usually charge a management fee including Operational Expenses as a percentage fee of the value of the fund.In this case, however, given that this is the pilot phase for the fund and that all the pre-work to set the fund up including the passing of the Tally vote and liaising with the Arbitrum Foundation has already been completed, we will waive all fees to run the fund in the pilot phase as a sign of our commitment and in order to make it as seamless as possible to prove the success of the fund in this first iteration.This fee waiver only applies to the current proposal. If there is an extension to the Subsidy Fund in the future, management fees will be included in the respective proposal.Operational Expenses BudgetPhase I highlighted the importance of including operational expenses in the budget: This is necessary to engage external subject matter experts - as we did with DeDaub in Phase I  - and cover operational expenses such as third party communication tools and collaboration infrastructure.To take this into account, we propose an additional budget of 15% Operational Expenses which will be allocated for the engagement of SMEs and for other operational expenses and running costs. The Operational Expenses budget includes (non-exhaustive):Infrastructure set-up for essential tools and infrastructure like centralized accounts for email, collaboration platforms, and document management systems;Implementing comprehensive document retention and IP management policies;Creating standardized templates and workflows for common processes;Allocation of budget for specialized external SMEs to address complex issues efficiently;Budget flexibility to accommodate unexpected challenges and community engagement needs.The remaining unused funds of this sub-budget will be returned to Arbitrum’s treasury after Phase II has been concluded.The Operational Expenses Budget for Phase II will total USD 54,000.ARB Token CalculationTo determine the ARB token amount, we used the 14-day Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of ARB/USD, each as listed EOD UTC, until EOD on Thu Sep 19 on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical_data), prior to the proposal being posted on Tally. This method ensures a fair and current valuation while mitigating short-term price volatility. We’ll add a 20% buffer to this amount to account for potential price fluctuations between proposal submission and execution. The remaining unused funds of this buffer will be returned to Arbitrum’s treasury after Phase II has been concluded.Total BudgetItemUSD AmountTWAP ARB AmountBaseline for Phase II Procurement Deliverables$360,000ARB 691,745Operational Expenses for external parties and services (15%)$54,000ARB 103,762Sub-Total$414,000ARB 795,507ARB Buffer (20%)$82,800ARB 159,101Total$496,800ARB 954,608The total budget requested is 954,608 ARB. Please find the Google sheet with the corresponding calculation of the TWAP ARB Amount here.A detailed breakdown of the budget can be found in the Google sheet here.VII. Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase IIMethodologyIn order to identify the verticals that will be most beneficial for the ADPC to tackle in Phase II, we created a non-weighted scoring system to rate all verticals against the following factors:Importance to Projects on ArbitrumThis factor takes into account the importance of the vertical with respect to the following criteria:  - Frequency of use of the vertical by Projects;Estimated spend under the vertical;Feedback from Arbitrum stakeholders regarding importance of vertical to Arbitrum ecosystem growth; andThe extent to which the Procurement Framework (PF) vertical helps make the process of building on Arbitrum, both for existing and new projects, more streamlined, cost-effective, and attractive, while simplifying and standardizing their engagement with service providers.Higher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.Importance to DAO Proposals & InitiativesThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by existing DAO proposals and initiatives, helps operationalize them, and increases their chances of success. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.Solving Existing DAO NeedsThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by the DAO in general, and how significantly the PF will help professionalize and operationalize the DAO further. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of utility to the DAO.Overlap with Existing DAO Initiatives / StructureThere are initiatives in the DAO or from the Foundation that are already tackling the problem solved by the PF. The ranking will take into account how well the PF vertical avoids overlap/duplication. Higher scores indicate PF is better at avoiding overlap/duplication.Procurement Complexity / CostThe complexity of constructing the procurement framework and the cost to do so. Higher ratings indicate lower complexity.Monetary Savings for Projects on ArbitrumThis criterion evaluates cost savings for projects on Arbitrum resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.Monetary Savings for DAOThis criterion evaluates cost savings for the DAO resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.Increase in Deployment EfficiencyThis criterion evaluates the extent to which an introduction of the PF makes deployment for new projects more efficient.  The greater the efficiency improvements, the higher the rating.Each of these factors are rated on a scale of 0 (Not Applicable at All), 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High), and higher scores are better.Note: Some of these factors are not applicable to some verticals. As such, the final score for each vertical is the percentage it has achieved, to enable comparability between verticals. For example, if the Events vertical has 6 factors that are applicable to it, the maximum score it can achieve is 18 and its final score is the percentage of the score it has achieved out of 18, so if it has achieved 17, its final score is 94%.Application of Methodology to FrameworksWe identified 27 verticals that we could potentially tackle in Phase II. The below table represents the scores per vertical with the methodology applied, in order from highest to lowest. For a detailed breakdown of the application of the methodology with rationales for each individual score, please see the table here.VerticalScoreEvents94%Tokenomics & Token Launch Teams91%DevRel Firms91%OTC Services88%KYC Providers86%Risk Service Providers86%RPC Providers81%Marketing79%Oracle Services76%API Providers76%Node Management Software71%Transaction Monitoring & Analytics Tools63%Identity Management62%BD / Partnerships Team58%Human Resourcing58%Cloud Providers52%Design / UI / UX48%Reporting Tools / Dashboards / Analytics42%Trademarks / Patents / IP Registrations & Defence38%Treasury Management Services38%Legal Firms Panel33%Training / Education Providers29%R&D29%Smart Contract Developers29%Lobby / Industry Groups25%Travel Providers22%Policy Development21%The verticals we selected to obtain further feedback on from high-context delegates, existing projects on Arbitrum, and new projects looking to build on Arbitrum, were those with scores >80% and constitute the below verticals:EventsTokenomics & Token Launch TeamsDevRel FirmsOTC ServicesKYC ProvidersRPC ProvidersNote:We did not initially include Risk Service Providers in the list of verticals since these were already available to the DAO via the ARDC. As such, we did not ask for specific feedback from delegates and stakeholders for this vertical.However, given that the ARDC may eliminate this function in its next iteration, we decided to include it in our list and, as it scored very highly, include it in the list of verticals to potentially tackle in Phase II.Community Engagement & Feedback CollectionAfter shortlisting the top six verticals, we decided to validate the shortlisted verticals with high-context delegates, existing Arbitrum projects, and new projects aiming to build on Arbitrum. The intention was to further narrow down the verticals to the two we would tackle in Phase II.We reached out to 25 stakeholders for feedback: L2Beat, Coinflip, GMX, DK, Gauntlet, Wintermute, Griff Green, Blockworks, Frisson, JoJo, Jones DAO, Pepperoni Jo3, Treasure, Camelot, Cattin, Premia, MUX Protocol, MaxLomu, Bob Rossi, Karpatkey, Princeton Blockchain Club, Bobbay, Angle Protocol, Merkl, and PaperImperium.Based on our interactions with the community, we decided to move forward with the procurement of RPC providers as the first vertical. This is because RPC costs are high, RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits, and technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a complex task that drains time and resources from projects. As such, creating a panel of whitelisted RPC providers streamlines the building process for projects.In addition, we locked in ‘Events’ as a second vertical. The reason for this is that we spoke with Entropy Advisors about the need for a coherent events strategy for Arbitrum DAO, which is also apparent from the multiple concurrent events proposals being proposed in the DAO. As a result, we decided to create a proposal alongside Entropy Advisors and DisruptionJoe to establish a DAO Events Strategy for 2025, which will be published soon. While the proposal on the DAO Events Strategy for 2025 is focused on defining in particular the type and distribution of events as a first step, event services and event providers have to be procured in a second step to execute on the identified strategy. This second step, i.e., the provision of those procurement services for the identified events, is the subject of this proposal.VIII. Transparency & Community EngagementAs in Phase I, the ADPC commits to maintaining its high standards of transparency and community engagement. We will:Continue to hold bi-weekly calls with the entire Arbitrum community, and when need be, make this more frequent;Continue to update the ADPC Update Thread on the forum;Post all meeting minutes and tasks on the ADPC’s public dashboard, with a view to further enhancing the dashboard to provide even more information to the community.IX. Checks & BalancesKindly note that Phase II of the ADPC’s term will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the Procurement Committee proposal, regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:Conflict of Interest Provision: ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.To sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.Record-keeping and Reporting: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.Duty of Impartiality: ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.Obligation of Recusal: ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.Prohibition of Self-Dealing: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.Ethical Trading: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.X. Multi-SigWe propose to use the Multi-Sig Support Service for Arbitrum DAO. Accordingly, we have taken advantage of the cost savings associated with that service and not included any costs for multi-sig management in this proposal.XI. ARB Conversion StrategyThe ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modeling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12.50.341260×448 44.8 KBProtocol-Owned ExecutionThe Protocol-Owned Execution strategy uses off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity, model price impact, and plan the execution of active and passive trading. Based on current market conditions, it will take < 1 week to swap out of 414k USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.For ARB on the Arbitrum Chain, Gauntlet will swap out tokens using either Odos (DEX aggregator) or BeBop (self-execution solver).Passive execution uses concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC pool (Odos supports projects such as Camelot, Uniswap V3, and more). The amount converted through this position is periodically claimed, and a new ARB position is set in the pool. These can be thought of as limit orders.Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12.51.401280×322 24.7 KBActive and passive execution are used in tandem to maximize liquidity sourcing. Price impact modeling and gas cost determine the intraday trading schedule and size. Historical data is used to determine initial parameters. We continuously monitor slippage, intraday price impact, and medium-term price impact and adjust execution parameters if necessary.Intraday price impact is measured as the likelihood of observable price divergence in the hour after trading. The medium-term impact is measured as the effect of trade size on the divergence relative to a peer benchmark.Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12.52.261260×914 96.3 KBThe example chart shows rolling slippage for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12.53.071306×894 51 KBThe example chart shows the likelihood of intraday impact for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.ADPC Vault ParametersChain: ArbitrumVault Owner: MSS (arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0)Guardian: GauntletTokens: ARB, USDCProtocols: Odos, Bebop, LlamapayStrategy: Swap ARB for USDC; minimizing market impactPayment Stream: streamed continuously over 6 months once the swap from ARB to USDC is completeFee: 0%ADPC Members Payment ProcessOnce the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.About AeraAera is an on-chain solution to optimize DAO funds autonomously. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management, which often hinders a DAO’s ability to maintain its runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on agile managers for fund allocation, DAOs face unique challenges, including governance and incentive alignment with external managers.To address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO’s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons.You can read more about Aera here."

This proposal is to provide the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) with one million ARB across two disbursements to support them in fulfilling their mission.
Introduction
The DeFi Education Fund (DEF) is the only advocacy organization that focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. The DEF uniquely provides a dedicated voice for DAOs and DeFi in legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy efforts. ","OverviewThis proposal is to provide the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) with one million ARB across two disbursements to support them in fulfilling their mission.IntroductionThe DeFi Education Fund (DEF) is the only advocacy organization that focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. The DEF uniquely provides a dedicated voice for DAOs and DeFi in legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy efforts. You can find a summary of their past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US, below.RationaleDeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.Originally funded by Uniswap governance in 2021 with a one million UNI grant, DeFi Education Fund’s work is a public good that periodically requires funding to continue. This proposal would contribute funding to the organization so that it can expand its legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.The DeFi Education Fund’s work focuses on (further details below):Legal advocacy and litigation for DeFi, DAOs, and developers;Fighting regulatory overreach from the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, CFPB, IRS, et. al.;Advocating and lobbying for DeFi in Congress and at the state level;Educating elected representatives and traditional media about DeFi and its benefits; andInforming and serving the DeFi community about policy and regulatory developments.DEF is eager to continue leading the charge in the fight on behalf of DeFi. We can only do that with the backing of the DeFi community, which is why we will be initiating governance proposals for financial support from several DAOs. With the community’s support, we willsuper charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; andenhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.More Information on DEFTeam: Miller Whitehouse-Levine, Amanda Tuminelli, Max Bernstein, and Lizandro PeiperWeekly updates on policy developments and activities12 Month Estimated BudgetHistorical financial information (annual and monthly)XContact - Please reach out to discuss!Email: miller@defieducationfund.orgTelegram: @millwlTwitter: @fund_defiImplementationUpon passage, 500,000 ARB is to be transferred to and held in a dedicated wallet at Coinbase. The remaining 500,000 ARB will be transferred six months after passage if the following deliverables have been met:The DEF posts monthly updates summarizing its activities to support decentralized finance on the Arbitrum forum;The DEF hosts update calls / Q&As at least every other month over this time period to keep the Arbitrum community updated on the legal and regulatory climate and on an ad hoc basis if there are important developments of interest to the Arbitrum community;The DEF is responsive to Arbitrum community questions and requests for information about policy developments or organizational developments; andThe DEF’s work continues to focus on DeFi and DAO advocacy.We hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months and publish a sales plan before selling any tokens.ConclusionThe DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.FAQsWhy are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?We are seeking Arbitrum’s support now for three primary reasons.First, we need a sense of our longer term funding in order to take on the projects that our work focuses on, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will take a total of at least two years from start to finish. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting that challenge, we would not have been able to take that project on. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States could cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects.Third, DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.Why are you asking Arbitrum for money and not other DAOs?We will definitely be passing around the hat! We seek Arbitrum’s support as a leading DAO that is building for the long term. The Uniswap DAO took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that other leading DAOs will contribute to funding our work going forward.When and how are you planning on selling tokens?It is important to us that the DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. We will hold half of any ARB tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will not sell any ARB tokens without pre-disclosing a sales plan in writing. For example, we received our initial grant from the Uniswap DAO in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18-month written sales plan. We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.ACCOMPLISHMENTSLegal AdvocacySEC v. Kraken - In February 2024, we submitted an amicus brief explaining the various incorrect and often inconsistent legal positions the SEC employs in its attempts to justify its position that digital asset transactions are securities transactions.Van Loon v. Treasury - In November 2023, we filed another amicus brief related to the Tornado Cash sanctions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We argued that the use of privacy-protecting technology is normal and not inherently illicit and that Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) exceeded its statutory authority in issuing sanctions that included purely domestic transactions.Harper v. Internal Revenue Service - In October 2023, we filed an amicus brief in a case involving a challenge to a “John Doe” summons the IRS sent to Coinbase that resulted in the collection of information (including information revealing on-chain wallet addresses) about 14,355 Americans (none of whom were accused of any wrongdoing prior to the summons) over a three-year period. Our brief explained the sweeping Fourth Amendment implications of indiscriminately collecting digital asset transaction information and how doing so is more revealing than in the context of TradFi.SEC v. Coinbase - In August 2023, we filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in support of Coinbase. We explained how wallets and staking actually work and supported Coinbase’s arguments that it is not a broker through its wallet software, nor did it offer securities through its staking program.Coin Center v. Treasury - In June 2023, we filed an amicus brief in support of a challenge to OFAC’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment ag. In October 2022, Coin Center and several individuals sued Treasury, challenging OFAC’s designation of Tornado Cash smart contracts. The plaintiffs argued that doing so exceeded the Treasury’s authority, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the First Amendment. Our brief supported arguments that the sanctions were beyond the Treasury Department’s statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, made the point that Tornado Cash is an important privacy-protection tool, and argued that the sanctions designations made no sense when considering the realities of the technology at issue.Van Loon v. Treasury - In April 2023, we submitted our first brief related to Treasury’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. In addition to Treasury’s lack of statutory basis for the actions, We argued that the downstream implications of sanctioning a software protocol will lead to not only a weakening of the digital asset industry, but will also seriously jeopardize law-abiding Americans’ financial privacy.CFTC v. Ooki DAO - In late 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) served Ooki DAO, alleging it is “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” without a Futures Commission Merchant designation or a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) program. The CFTC served “Ooki DAO” via a help chat box with a contemporaneous notice posted on a website purportedly affiliated with Ooki DAO. We filed a brief in the case explaining: “First, the Commission has named Ooki DAO as a defendant in this action, asserting that Ooki DAO is an “unincorporated association comprised of Ooki Token holders.” But nothing about the structure of a DAO inherently dictates that result. In many cases, DAOs lack any central organization or management, and many DAO token holders often lack coordination or common objectives. As a result, DAOs will often not be “associations” of any kind, and therefore will not be proper defendants in an enforcement action brought under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), which requires that a defendant be a “person” (defined to include “associations”). The Commission has not yet alleged facts sufficient to establish that Ooki DAO is an association, so its attempt to serve Ooki DAO here is premature.”Combatting crypto patent trolls: In September 2023, we took action to protect DeFi and crypto from invalid patent infringement claims. We filed a petition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to initiate an inter partes review and cancellation of all claims in a patent owned by True Return Systems LLC. TRS is a patent troll who first tried to sell the patent as an NFT, and when that didn’t work, sued both MakerDAO and Compound Protocol in federal court for alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,025,797. Our petition argued that the technology that TRS purported to patent was not in fact TRS’s invention, but was instead very similar to oracle technology that had been in development and use for years prior to the patent.Regulatory AdvocacyIn January 2024, we urged the Department of the Treasury to reconsider its proposed rule to classify crypto “mixing” transactions to be a “primary money laundering concern” subject to enhanced reporting requirements. Among the issues we commented on is the proposal’s all-encompassing definition of “mixing,” which would capture almost all crypto transactions and designate them to be “high risk.”In January 2024, we submitted our thoughts on a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed rulemaking that could expand the CFPB’s supervisory authority to capture self-hosted wallets. We argued that the rulemaking should not move forward as it would further scramble the Federal government’s already-convoluted regulatory treatment of DeFi and crypto-related activities.In November 2023, we filed a comment letter regarding the Treasury Department’s proposed “broker” rulemaking. The proposed rule would introduce a brand new category of broker called a “digital asset middleman,” a new term that is essentially limitless in scope and creates brokers out of thin air in DeFi and, as we argue, runs contrary to the statute and legislative history. Furthermore, we argued that the proposal violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures of a person’s papers and effects because individuals do not voluntarily turn over their personal data to “digital asset middlemen” who themselves neither collect nor have any legitimate business reason to collect that information. For a plain language review of our issues with the rulemaking, read: “Congress Gets the Runaround From Regulators, Again.”In October 2023, we responded to France’s Autorité de Marchés Financiers (AMF) concerning their DeFi regulatory discussion paper. Our comment letter addressed many topics including permissionless blockchain protocols, legal enforceability of smart contracts, off-chain elements, etc. Importantly, we addressed the legal liability of smart contract developers, arguing that smart contracts’ code is open-source for anyone to audit and make informed decisions. Furthermore, we argued that open-source code is a form of expression as it conveys ideas for societal change and demands protection. We also argued against the AMF’s proposal to create a government-run certification regime for smart contracts.In September 2023, we responded to a request for comment from the Senate Finance Committee regarding the taxation of digital assets. In our submission, we recommended Congress: 1) Revise Section 6050I so that it does not “deputize recipients of digital assets to collect and report information about their payers;” 2) Do not tax staking rewards until a sale or other disposition; 3) Do not apply wash sale rules to taxpayers who utilize digital assets as a form of currency; and 4) explicitly extend the application of section 1058’s nonrecognition rule to “loans” of actively traded fungible tokens.In June 2023, we submitted a response to a consultation from HM Revenue and Customs, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments, and customs authority, regarding “the taxation of DeFi involving the lending and staking of cryptoassets.” At a high-level, our submission noted that any changes to the tax regime that concern DeFi must: be flexible to account for future innovation; exhibit clarity and simplicity to promote compliance by minimizing the burden on taxpayers; and align with the underlying economic substance of a typical DeFi transaction.In June 2023, we submitted a response to Banque of France’s Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) regarding their discussion paper: “Decentralised’ or ‘Disintermediated’ Finance: What Regulatory Response?” Our primary arguments included that ACPR should not directly regulate miners and validators by establishing standards for public blockchains; a policy that would “force centralization” would eliminate the core innovations of public blockchains; and a framework for smart contract certification would require centralization and the inappropriate regulation of speech.In June 2023, we filed our third comment letter on the SEC’s proposed “exchange” rulemaking. Our brief made two primary arguments: first, the proposal improperly reads and misapplies the Exchange Act and exceeds the SEC’s statutory authority and mandate under the Act; and second, the SEC has flatly failed to comply with numerous procedural and statutory rulemaking requirements.In August 2022, the DEF filed a response to the U.S. Treasury Department’s request for comment on innovation in digital assets. In our response, we explained how DeFi protocols have the potential to benefit consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States and around the world by creating accessible financial infrastructure usable by any individual with an internet connection.In June 2022, we responded to Abu Dhabi’s DeFi consultation, in which we expressed our view that decentralization and disintermediation serve important societal objectives and that forcing the reintroduction of intermediation via legal obligations is a misguided approach to DeFi that would undermine its core potential and innovation.In June 2022, In our second letter on the SEC’s exchange rulemaking, we argued that the proposed rule represents an improperly static regulatory response to a dynamic innovation and therefore needs to be reconsidered in total.In May 2022, we commented on the SEC’s “dealer” rulemaking, which could not only subject large DeFi market participants to the threat of arbitrary SEC enforcement actions but also, potentially, capture liquidity pools themselves as so-called “dealers” under the securities laws. But how would it do so? In what way? The SEC did not say when it proposed the rule nor when it later finalized the rule in early 2024, which we expect to see challenged in court. .In April 2022, we submitted the first of three comment letters on the SEC’s “exchange” rulemaking, which would de facto ban DeFi protocols in the United States. We argued that the Proposal’s expanded definition of an “exchange” is so broad that it could be interpreted to cover DeFi market participants, yet the rule didn’t specify which or why—it didn’t even mention “crypto,” “DeFi,” or “digital assets” once. In January 2023 in response to these concerns, the SEC released 167 pages of additional information explaining that the proposal does apply to DeFi and crypto, which we also responded to.In April 2022, we submitted a comment letter to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on its proposed framework for tax reporting in the digital asset ecosystem. Broadly, when it comes to DeFi, the proposal fits squarely in the “how do we apply existing regulations and tactics to innovative systems” camp. This concept would force the creation of intermediaries where they do not exist for tax reporting purposes, a concept that the Treasury Department is now attempting to enshrine in the United States (see November 2023 comment letter on the IRS’s proposed “broker” rulemaking).Legislative AdvocacyThe past year has yielded some fruit in the industry’s push for crypto-specific legislation, but legislation is still a few years out, in our view. In July, The House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) voted, with bipartisan support, to advance the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S. That same month, the HFSC advanced a bill to establish a federal regulatory regime for stablecoins.More recently, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed the Deploying American Blockchains Act (by a 46-0 margin), which would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce “to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.” While these bills are not perfect, we’re pleased that Congress has taken a serious approach to these matters.There’s another factor that gives us hope for the long-term chances of good legislation passing both chambers. And that is the willingness of Congressional offices and policymakers to engage with DEF and learn about the foundational aspects of the technology. We do “DeFi Demos” on Capitol Hill and advocate for policies welcoming of DeFi and DAOs. We explain why we believe in DeFi and why government officials and elected representatives should be just as curious as we are as to how this technology can improve the lives of their constituents. Away from sensational media headlines and televised hearings, one can see that a better, more open future for DeFi is developing.Specifically, we’ve provided a perspective from DeFi’s corner on the following federal legislation:H.R. 1122, CBDC Anti-Surveillance State ActH.R. 1177/S. 427, Financial Freedom Act of 2023H.R. 1414.

What’s needed instead for the 60 million Americans who own digital assets today are “fit-for-purpose tax provisions” that basically regard crypto as a different sort of case.Law360: USPTO To Review Blockchain IP Used To ‘Troll’ Crypto FirmsThe challenge has been led by the DeFi Education Fund, a crypto advocacy group that says that the technology the patent covers predates the patent itself and has called True Return Systems a “patent troll” that threatens to force anyone using oracle systems to pay. On the same day in 2022, True Return Systems brought two suits against what amount to technology programs, arguing that they were infringing on the True Return Systems patent.Bankless Podcast: The US Government is Trying to Kill CryptoWe need to stop the US from killing crypto. The new IRS proposals could effectively destroy DeFi and other crypto use cases. The good news? We can change this. 5 minutes is all it takes to leave a comment and get the interpretation delayed. In this episode, we bring on Miller Whitehouse-Levine of the DeFi Education Fund and tax lawyer Jason Schwartz to discuss the proposed rules and their catastrophic implications.Law360: Crypto Group Urges 1st Circ. To Revive IRS Doc Seizure SuitA New Hampshire federal court failed to understand the distinctive features of cryptocurrency technology when it determined that the seizure, issued by John Doe summons, did not violate James Harper’s Fourth Amendment right to privacy, DeFi Education Fund argued in an amicus brief. DeFi is a research group that advocates for the benefits of decentralized finance, including cryptocurrency.Decrypt: Taxes Targeting DeFi Would be ‘Awfully Challenging’: Coinbase VPToday, Washington, D.C. nonprofit Defi Education Fund said on Twitter that “the proposed ‘broker’ rulemaking… must be stopped” because it would raise “serious tax policy and privacy concerns.”Cointelegraph: Crypto advocates file amicus brief to address users’ Fourth Amendment privacy rightsCryptocurrency advocacy group the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) has urged a United States court to consider the unique aspects of blockchain technology when evaluating the privacy rights of cryptocurrency users under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.Law360: DeFi Org Asks USPTO To Review Blockchain IP Held By ‘Troll’Crypto advocacy group the DeFi Education Fund has asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Monday to take a look at a patent held by a firm it said is “trolling” decentralized finance entities with lawsuits over a blockchain system the group claims is “indistinguishable” from solutions that came before it.Law360: CFTC Enforcement Cases May Force DeFi To Comply Or LeaveThe DeFi Education Fund advocacy group said in a statement to Law360 that the CFTC enforcement actions “completely reject” the New York court’s finding…“The CFTC’s enforcement actions yesterday completely reject the court’s decision in Risley v. Uniswap Labs, which found that it ‘defies logic’ to hold the developer of a DeFi protocol liable for a third party’s potential misuse of that software,” the DeFi Education Fund said.DL News: The Guidance: A peak into lobbyists’ agendaWhile the stablecoin and market structure bills are front of mind, for the DeFi Education Fund, Senator Elisabeth Warren and Senator Roger Marshall’s bill on anti-money laundering provisions for digital assets is the priority…“What they propose to essentially do is make miners and validators financial intermediaries for regulatory purposes or software developers,” Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the Fund, told DL News. “So it’s highly problematic and certainly would kill the industry in the United States."" But Whitehouse-Levine is hopeful because “everyone’s objective is the same, it’s just a matter of accomplishing how this objective is going to work.”Bloomberg: Treasury Aims to Snag Tax Cheats With Crypto Broker Proposal“Today’s proposal from the IRS is confusing, self-refuting, and misguided,” said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, chief executive officer of the DeFi Education Fund.The Wall Street Journal: U.S. Tackles Crypto Tax Mess“It attempts to apply regulatory frameworks predicated on the existence of intermediaries where they don’t exist.”Reuters: Biden administration unveils new crypto tax reporting rulesMiller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, a lobbying group focused on decentralized finance, said the proposed approach would neither make filing taxes easier nor improve tax compliance.CoinDesk: U.S. Senator Lummis, Crypto Lobbyists Urge Court to Dismiss SEC’s Coinbase LawsuitIn total, lobby organizations including the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Chamber of Digital Commerce, DeFi Education Fund, Chamber of Progress, Consumer Technology Association, venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm and half a dozen academics filed a total of six briefs, not including the Senator’s.Blockworks: DeFi Education Fund seeks FOIA amid SEC inaction on securities disputeThe DeFi Education Fund recently utilized the Freedom of Information Act to file a request for additional information regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision not to provide clarity on the classification of syndicated loans as securities.POLITICO: What’s that cloud look like? To Chopra, stability risk“He previously tweeted about being pro-innovation and wanting to keep development of this industry onshore,” DeFi Education Fund CEO Miller Whitehouse-Levine told MM. “Given the contents of the bill, I do think his position has apparently changed.”The Block: Senate bill would tighten money laundering and sanctions rules for DeFiThe bill would “effectively ban DeFi development in the country,” argued Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, in a statement decrying the legislation. “Unfortunately, this approach is not only a disproportionate response to the illicit use of DeFi but also risks undermining US law enforcement’s existing insight and reach into peer-to-peer crypto activity,” Whitehouse-Levine said.Blockworks: SEC’s proposed exchange definition would cause ‘de facto expatriation’ of DeFi companies“The upshot of this technological reality is that holding DeFi protocols to the requirements of the regulatory regimes governing national securities exchanges and ATSs would result in their de facto expatriation from the United States. DeFi is rapidly gaining trading market share in crypto assets, especially after recent and high-profile fraud and compliance issues at leading centralized and intermediated non-U.S. crypto asset exchanges,” the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) wrote in a 47-page response letter.CoinDesk: U.S. SEC Out-of-Bounds in Dragging DeFi Into Proposed Exchange Rule, Industry Says“The proposal would operate as a blanket de facto banishment of DeFi from the United States,” the DeFi Education Fund, a lobbying group, wrote in its comment letter. “The actions and words of the commission and agency personnel have created great confusion.”The Capitol Account: Talking `Impact’ Litigation; SEC Officials on Hotseat in House; Stepping up Merger Scrutiny; Banks Bash SEC Custody PlanAmanda Tuminelli, who is the new chief legal officer at the DeFi Education Fund, thinks there is probably a better way to get answers – in court. Her role at the decentralized finance advocacy group is to spearhead “impact litigation” designed to bring more clarity about the rules digital assets need to follow. And even though she’s only been on the job since March, Tuminelli already has a few targets in mind. (SEC Chair Gary Gensler may want to watch out.)Axios: U.S. Treasury looks at DeFi and crime“Those frameworks were developed based on how the global economy worked in the 1970s, and are predicated on the assumption that transactions must occur through custodial financial intermediaries,” DeFi Education Fund CEO Miller Whitehouse-Levine said in a statement.POLITICO: DeFi’s turn in the barrel“DeFi protocols function in a different way than traditional finance, and trying to apply existing AML/CFT rules, isn’t going to accomplish AML/CFT objectives,” DeFi Education Fund policy director Miller Whitehouse-Levine told MM.Blockworks: Treasury Review Acknowledges Traditional Finance, Not DeFi, Preferred by Criminals“While the assessment does, at times, demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of the DeFi landscape, it evidences a tension between the idea that decentralization is irrelevant in determining compliance obligations under existing AML/CFT controls and the idea that decentralized protocols are a novel tool unanticipated by existing frameworks,” Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, said in an email.The Defiant: Gensler Refuses To Call Ether A Security At Congressional HearingMiller Whitehouse-Levine, who heads the DeFi Education Fund crypto advocacy group, said Gensler’s appearance “underscores the thesis that [he] has made the policy choice to try and ban crypto in this country.”The Defiant: “Everybody” Should be Concerned About the SEC’s Proposed Rule Change for DeFi“Everybody and their mother,” should be concerned, Whitehouse-Levine said in an interview. Validators of blockchain transactions, members of DAOs, and open source developers, are potentially liable, he said. The DeFi Education Fund is a research firm which advocates for DeFi with policy-makers.Capitol Account: Grading Gensler: Advocates Assess SEC Chief Two Years InTop line: F- [grade]. Chair Gensler has morphed the SEC from being the gold standard of financial regulators – an agency that protects American investors and the primacy of its capital markets by adapting its statutorily-authorized regulations to innovative technologies – to being an agency that actively engages in merit-based policymaking. That approach is undermining the SEC’s pursuit of its mission and its credibility already. And in turn, it risks doing lasting damage to the agency and the markets it oversees.The Block: Fighting a digital dollar becomes new conservative crypto cause to champion“A CBDC’s potential for misuse is quite potent. It could severely encroach on Americans’ right to financial privacy and enable an unprecedented degree of control over individuals’ private transactions,” Whitehouse-Levine said. “Protecting the right to financial privacy is a non-partisan issue.”Reuters: Wall St watchdog shortens time-frame for stock trades, proposes new investment adviser rulesHowever Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director at DeFi Education Fund, described Gensler’s position as an attempt to cut off digital assets from the traditional financial system. “This should end any doubt that ‘come in and register’ is a fig leaf for the SEC usurping Congress to block crypto in the U.S.,” he said.New York Times Dealbook: Investors Await a Momentous Inflation ReportThe left-right divisions run deep. Despite a shared sense of urgency, the gulf between party leaders on the details of any approach to crypto regulation is wide, said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director of the DeFi Education Fund, a crypto lobbying group. “It’ll be a lot of work to get consensus,” he said, and he doesn’t foresee legislation passing any time soon.Capitol Account: Calling SEC Investor Rule Discriminatory, House Republicans Plot Fresh Push to Open Up PE and Hedge Funds to the MassesHere’s a response from Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the DeFi Education Fund’s policy director: “The blog post is mistitled. The potential (further) broad decline in digital asset prices, the potential composition of custodial stablecoin reserves, and the potential mass use of a digital asset for payments are not DeFi issues.”Cointelegraph: Blockchain privacy groups urge new US Congress to protect privacy rightsAt the time of writing, the letter had 36 signatories, including industry players such as the Blockchain Association, DeFi Education Fund, Ledger, Nillion Network, Protocol Labs and Proton.Capitol Account: Crypto Turf Fight: a Progressive Attack on CFTC’s Behnam Gets Personal – and UglyAs the head of the DeFi Education Fund, Miller Whitehouse-Levine often notes that he spends much of his time explaining to confused lawmakers what his industry does. Toward that end, the group isn’t wasting any time getting its education efforts going with the new Congress.

If anything, I think it has added much more to think about in the next few months.”The Block: Crypto industry protests against Treasury’s proposed tax reporting regulationThe Defi Education Fund said earlier this month in its letter that the proposal stretches the definition of a broker beyond its constitutional limits and that the Treasury is essentially creating a new kind of broker called a “digital asset middleman.” The proposed regulations’ definition of ‘digital asset middleman’ is vague to the point of being unintelligible,” Miller Whitehouse-Levine and Amanda Tuminelli — CEO and chief legal officer of advocacy group the DeFi Education Fund respectively — wrote in a letter to the IRS.Fortune: The obscure DAO at the center of a case that could determine the future of crypto“These are questions of fairness and liability that are generally handled via state law,” said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director at DeFi Education Fund.The Lexcon Crypto Show: Was the CFTC right to sue Ooki Dao?

The Attackathon will focus on enhancing the security of the Ethereum protocol through three phases: education, active code hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed from the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring the stability and security of Ethereum, which is vital for maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.MotivationAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum relies heavily on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given Arbitrum’s EVM compatibility, vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum as well. Conducting a comprehensive security audit contest at this time is critical due to the recent major hard forks that have introduced significant changes to Ethereum.A key component of this Attackathon is the development of educational materials that cater to all levels of security knowledge. This educational program will feature live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation developed by the Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi, covering a broad scope that includes client, specification, and solidity compiler bugs. By educating security researchers, the Attackathon will cultivate a community of researchers capable of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems. This increased awareness and participation in Ethereum’s security ultimately benefits the Arbitrum community by ensuring the continued reliability and safety of the underlying blockchain infrastructure.RationaleThe Attackathon aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission to promote a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By investing in this initiative, Arbitrum will help Ethereum’s security, which directly impacts Arbitrum’s scalability and user trust. Moreover, the educational component of the Attackathon will benefit Arbitrum by upskilling security researchers, providing them with the knowledge and tools needed to conduct thorough audits and improve security across the network.Additionally, Arbitrum can benefit from the collaborative efforts of the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi, positioning itself as a proactive leader in the Ethereum community. Participation in the Attackathon provides Arbitrum with the opportunity to engage with top security researchers and improve its security posture. As a sponsor, Arbitrum will gain visibility and credibility among developers and users, further solidifying its reputation as a secure and forward-thinking.Key TermsAttackathon: A comprehensive and time boxed security audit event involving education, active vulnerability hunting, and result evaluation phases.Immunefi: A leading bug bounty platform specializing in blockchain and smart contract security.Hard Fork: Significant upgrades or changes to the protocol that may introduce new code and, potentially, new vulnerabilities.Solidity Compiler: The tool used to compile Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity into bytecode, which is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.SpecificationsPlatforms and Technologies:Ethereum Protocol: The primary focus of the security audit, with an emphasis on identifying vulnerabilities in core protocol code, client software, and the Solidity compiler.Immunefi: The platform hosting the Attackathon, responsible for managing submissions, triaging bug reports, and distributing rewards.Ethereum Foundation: Providing funding and oversight for the Attackathon, including contributions to the reward pool and logistical support.Design Decisions:Scope: The contest will have a broad scope including specification bugs, client bugs, deposit contract bugs and Solidity compiler vulnerabilities.Inclusion of the Solidity Compiler: By including the Solidity compiler in the scope, the Attackathon directly addresses potential vulnerabilities in the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, which is crucial for both Ethereum and Arbitrum.Related Work:Ethereum Bug Bounty Program: The permanent bug bounty program has been effective but lacks visibility. The Attackathon aims to increase participation and awareness through a focused, large-scale event.Steps to ImplementThe primary role of the Arbitrum DAO in this initiative is to provide funding support for the Attackathon. By contributing to the reward pool, Arbitrum will ensure that the event attracts top-tier security researchers and maximizes its impact on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Additionally, the Arbitrum community can assist in promoting the Attackathon to raise awareness and encourage participation.Estimated TimelineJuly 8-11: EthCC program announcementAug 19th: Detailed program announcement and education kickoffSeptember 2nd: Attackathon hunting beginsOctober 27th: Attackathon concludes, and results compilation beginsOctober 28th: Review period beginsEarly January: Results announcedOverall CostThe Arbitrum DAO has two options for sponsoring the Attackathon:Unicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment) (limited to two sponsors)1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rankParticipation in Attackathon Kick-off Twitter Space as a partner speakerLeaderboard Placement on Sponsor pageTop-tier logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing PageTop-tier logo placement on the Program Education page and program reportCall out in Press Releases and EF and Immunefi Program Announcement BlogsDigital Logo Placement in the results announcement at Devcon or a dedicated virtual eventAn Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handlePanda Partners (+30 ETH Commitment)1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rankLeaderboard listing on the sponsor landing pageMid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing PageAn Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handleBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum can leverage the findings to ensure its network remains robust against vulnerabilities.

It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.The proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the L2 Core Time Lock contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days.There are two benefits to increasing the delay:Security Council. The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.Exit window. Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied about how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.Additionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.The downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by an additional 5 days. It does not impact or add an additional delay to any spending from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury including ARB and ETH.Time Lock Extension1600×809 143 KBImage: Overview of the Current Time LocksAll proposals voted on and passed by the ArbitrumDAO must pass through an L2 Time Lock before it can move onto the next stage.There are currently two L2 Time Locks that are implemented via the on-chain governance smart contracts.L2 Treasury TimeLock. Delays all spends from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH Treasury.L2 Core TimeLock. Delays any actions related to on-chain upgrades.The proposal focuses on the Core L2 TimeLock. It is responsible for passing messages that contain executable code and it has the authority to upgrade any smart contract in the system including on-chain governance and the bridges (holding user assets) on Arbitrum One/Nova.If you want to learn more about the governance of smart contracts, please check out this diagram and the docs.Steps to Implement & TimelineThe proposal is to change the value of _minDelay from 259200 (seconds) to 691200 (seconds) in the L2 Timelock contract. This will change the time delay from 3 days to 8 days, an additional 5 days.The action contract is implemented and still pending an audit:github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governanceUpdates timelock delayArbitrumFoundation:main ← ArbitrumFoundation:update-timelock-delay          opened 01:48PM - 07 Aug 24 UTC            yahgwai          +50-0Seatbelt: https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/pull/34Additionally, we will need to update the ArbitrumDAO Constitution:Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs.

This proposal does NOT seek to transfer any large funds, only enough to elect, empower and compensate dealmakers who upload token swap agreements on Tally for ArbitrumDAO to directly approve.Motivation - This is the second of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program proposals put forth by the Treasury Working Group, formed in September ‘23 with a mandate to propose best in class solutions for diversifying Arbitrums treasury, currently containing ~3.5 billion ARB.Token swaps are a form of treasury diversification that increases Arbitrum alignment of protocols. In our view, token swaps should be the final stage of ecosystem support by the DAO, which could begin with a small Questbook grant and finally graduate to a direct token swap with us..RationaleA. Ecosystem Growth : We see broadly three categories of projects that would benefit from and apply for token swapsBuilders: Some founders, such as Susruth Nadimpalli of Catalog (Ren Protocol), were seeking an L2 they could devote themselves to. A token swap emerged as one way to ensure they build on our chain.Mature Apps: Many of the top apps in Arbitrum have their own token. Although some of them have ARB in their treasuries because of the airdrop, we do not possess any of their tokens. We think ARB DAO should seriously think of getting a nonzero amount of the top tokens in our ecosystem to promote closer integration with successful dapps on our chain and more generally create positive sentiment in the ARB ecosystem.Orbit Adoption: The third category consist of big players that want to launch their own Orbit L2 or appchain. For example, Celo is researching a tech stack for their chains. A token swap deal can help cement their decision of choosing Orbit over its competitors for their L2.More broadly, getting a voice in the apps in our ecosystem may prove critical in the future for ensuring they remain Arbitrum aligned (such as by voting against their migration from our chain). At the same time, for it to truly be an ecosystem growth initiative, we need to ensure it doesn’t appear that the DAO is picking winners and that the source of tokens we receive in the swap is not from the founder encashing their holdings but a community treasury with clear guidelines on holding periods.B. Treasury Diversification : The first proposal by our WG diversified our treasury into stable RWAs such as tokenized t-bills, while helping with ecosystem support through the DAO being a customer of such products built on our chain. The present token swap proposal takes this one step further by becoming more closely integrated with apps in our ecosystem through owning their tokens.More generally, we do not think apps that have launched their own token should be receiving large grants from ArbitrumDAO. People will always line up for free money; but when they have to give something in return such as their token, they would be more judicious about the amounts they are requesting.Some of the risks to take care of are avoiding what happened to FTX with their BitDAO token swap. After $BIT migrated their token and became $MNT, they invalidated all tokens held by the FTX estate by preventing their exchange. We also want to prevent one sided deals where we hold in perpetuity while the other side liquidates ARB received. In the future, a DAO treasury manager could keep tabs on alt tokens in our treasury and recommend or even unilaterally hold power to liquidate them with an explanation to the DAO.SpecificationsOne big issue with token swaps are price increases upon announcement of a deal. We want to mitigate this issue by the elected dealmakers making the announcement of projects shortlisted via an onchain proposal on Tally, with the applicant locking in terms of the deal using Hedgey’s token swap escrow tool and Arbitrum DAO accepting or rejecting the deal via a direct onchain Tally vote.All shortlisted applicants will need to undergo KYC with the Foundation, before any deal is uploaded on Tally.We would also let dealmakers negotiate the vesting lengths, lockup periods and other details, which would vary depending on the applicants requirement (a builder seeking a token swap would be different from one launching their orbit chain and wanting a voice in governance).Steps to ImplementSnapshot approval of the proposalElections for dealmakers held on SnapshotTally vote approving or rejecting the dealmakers elected in the Snapshot poll and transferring remuneration to them (in case the DAO is not satisfied with the candidates or changes its mind, they can reject the proposal at this stage).Dealmakers put out an RFP for projects to apply for token swaps with Arbitrum DAOShortlisted applicants complete KYC, lock up their tokens in escrow and dealmakers upload the deal on Tally ; if passed, tokens are swapped between our treasuries and if rejected, applicant gets back their tokens.TimelineApril : Solicit comments and feedback on the proposalMay : Put forth a Snapshot vote and if successful, invite applications for people to become ARB DAO dealmakersJune : Snapshot election for appointing dealmakersJuly : Onchain tally vote to authorize and pay elected dealmakersAugust-October: RFP for DAOs seeking token swaps + search and review of applicantsNovember: Submission window closes and KYC checks for shortlisted candidatesDecember : Upload deals for the DAO to vote on TallyJanuary : Vote on continuation of the program or its disbandingOverall Cost : 210,000 ARBWe are still working out the right amount of pay and seek feedback from the DAO and interested candidates in the position. We propose 35k ARB to each of the 5 dealmakers and the Treasury WG as facilitating, nonvoting member except in tie-breaks (upper range should be 50k and lower 20k)35,000 x 6 = 210,000 ARBThis will be the only incurred cost in the proposal, as the DAO will directly approve or reject any token swap deal uploaded to Tally.We are keeping a soft target of uploading token swap deals worth at least 10 million ARB before seeking additional funds for continuation of the program. 2% of this amount for implementation is reasonable by industry standards , especially considering the power these dealmakers have.As a concluding note, we would highlight that it is not terribly important whether these deals are approved or rejected, just that apps in our ecosystem are aware of Arbitrum’s token swap ecosystem support program that they may one day benefit from."

While the on-chain implementation will be independently audited by Trail of Bits before the Tally vote, the long term performance of Timeboost can only truly be evaluated with real-world data - data that can help hone and fine-tune Timeboost’s design for the benefit of the ArbitrumDAO.To that end, although the auctioneer will function autonomously, this AIP proposes granting the current sequencer operator the below rights to make the following adjustments from time to time for a period of two (2) years. The rights described below are expected to only be exercised in circumstances where doing so would enhance Timeboost’s long-term stability, preserve or improve the user experience for those using Timeboost-enabled Arbitrum chains, increase the security posture, resiliency, or stability of the chain, and/or otherwise help increase revenue for the ArbitrumDAO:The right to adjust the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter, which is the default delay that non-express lane transactions would be subject to. The default is 200ms, but adjustments could be to any value between 100ms & 500ms, inclusive.The right to change the maxBidsPerSenderInRound parameter, a limit on the number of bids per participant per auction round, to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the auctioneer. The starting default will be 5.The right to change the reservePrice to respond quickly to opportunities to increase the DAO revenue from Timeboost bid proceeds and/or to mitigate the risks of bidders colluding. To start, the reservePrice will simply be the minReservePrice.The ability to rotate the auctioneer’s key for submitting bids and the reserve price setter key for changing reservePrice.The right to pause the acceptance and verification of bids. This is to allow the current sequencer operator to provide reliable, consistent UX and maximize infrastructure stability.The right to disable Timeboost entirely in the event of a security risk or otherwise malicious attempt to harm Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova node operators, existing deployed applications, and/or end users. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.Modifications to other Timeboost parameters, including to values outside the specified ranges and to those not already listed above, but which are otherwise listed in the design specification, will require a constitutional governance vote, in accordance with the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. In cases where the ArbitrumDAO wishes to pause or disable Timeboost, the ArbitrumDAO may use the outcome of a Snapshot vote to do so (since Timeboost has an off-chain component). This special provision allows the ArbitrumDAO to react to market conditions quicker than what a Tally, on-chain vote would allow (~14 days as opposed to ~30 days).Additionally, it is important to emphasize that for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, the DAO-elected Arbitrum Security Council can, at any time, perform either Emergency Actions or Non-Emergency Actions to execute software upgrades, perform routine maintenance, and other parameter adjustments to Timeboost, in each case in accordance with its existing powers. These actions can include, but are not limited solely to, exercising the rights proposed above for the current sequencer operator. More information about the Arbitrum Security Council and their scope of powers can be found in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution.Submitted by: The Arbitrum FoundationCategory: Constitutional, Software UpgradeAbstractThis AIP proposes the adoption of Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum One and Nova. Timeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion and allowing them to potentially capture arbitrage and backrunning opportunities. Proceeds from the auction are at the discretion of the Arbitrum DAO, with two main options outlined in this proposal: collecting bids in ETH or collecting bids in ARB.MotivationArbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come First-Served basis (FCFS). The motivation to implement FCFS was threefold:Easy to understand and implement,Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation,Protect users against front-running,Unfortunately, relying solely on first-come first-served transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution.When opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, “MEV Searchers” race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.Timeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.RationaleSustainable: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured already exists.Technically-Inclusive: Rather than capturing arbitrage opportunities by having the fastest hardware, participants can win these opportunities by bidding in an auction.Neutral and Open: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins.Empowerment: The Arbitrum DAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction’s design, and how to handle proceeds.Key TermsExpress Lane: A separate path for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.MEV: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.SpecificationsThe full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: GitHub - OffchainLabs/timeboost-design.The implementation consists of an auction contract and autonomous auctioneer:Auction contract - Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders’ signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.Autonomous auctioneer - An offchain program that receives bids from participants and resolves the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the current sequencer operator provision and set up the autonomous auctioneer, if Timeboost is adopted.Timeboost changes the guarantees around transaction submission and introduces two different paths:Normal path - Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms), but will otherwise remain unchanged.Express lane - Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.Nearly all users will continue to submit transactions using the normal path. Timeboost introduces an express lane that can be purchased by sophisticated actors (like searchers) via an auction every minute, with each auction closing 15 seconds before the next round begins.All bids in the auction are kept private until after the bid submission deadline and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. A bid will only be accepted if it is at or above a minimum bid (the reservePrice). The autonomous auctioneer has the right to change the reservePrice, but it cannot be lower than the minReservePrice, which can only be changed by the ArbitrumDAO. Note, the reservePrice does not represent the expected value of a bid for the express lane, it is just a minimum bid that will be accepted.We propose setting the minReservePrice to either 0.001 ETH or 3 ARB depending on which currency the DAO votes to collect bids in.The ArbitrumDAO can configure the currency in which bids are collected and how the remaining 97% of auction proceeds are handled. This AIP proposes two main options that the community can vote on if it decides to adopt Timeboost. Governance can change these options at any time.Collect ETH - Collect bids in ETH and send the proceeds to the DAO treasury.Burn ARB - Collect bids in ARB and burn the proceeds.Depending on which option the Arbitrum DAO chooses, the auction contract can either transfer the proceeds to a designated account or burn them.The following data sources will eventually be saved and made available after Timeboost goes live on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, if this proposal passes:Historical bid data for auction participants, outside of the two highest bids (that are otherwise posted on-chain)A way to label/identify which transactions were sequenced in the express lane (i.e. Timeboosted transactions).Finally, the proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer. However, the Timeboost policy will also be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer. 3% of auction proceeds would be set aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development.Timeboost Implementation AdjustmentsTimeboost’s design is the culmination of over a year of research and development by the team at Offchain Labs.

App","Abstract - On June 12th 2024, the DAO held an election for the role of STEP program manager to oversee ~$30 million diversified into liquid, stable and yield bearing RWAs .Steakhouse Financial won the vote with 60% in favor of their selection. However, the tally vote earmarked 100k ARB as payment to program manager for one year (which converted to $86,581) while Steakhouse quoted a fee of $174,000 in their application. This proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options toApprove only a 6 month contract from available fundsEarmark additional funds so they complete their one year tenureNot have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs andConduct a new RFP to select a  program manager for one year at $86,581AbstainMotivation - On April 10th 2024, the DAO approved 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.In their application, Steakhouse quoted $174,000 per year. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay for a full year of the Program Manager’s services, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.Rationale - While writing the Tally proposal, I budgeted 100k ARB for the program manager role based on a quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.Steakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared a budget in dollar value, not ARB. As a result, i under-budgeted the program manager role in the STEP program and now need approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.Specifications - The STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.Steps to Implement -  After ratification of their role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.Timeline -Post on forumUpload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)Foundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposalAfter RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419  (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)Overall Cost - If the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.Work done in shepherding this proposal is paid for through a Thrivecoin firestarter grant to the Arbitrum treasury and sustainability group."

With a team of network scientists, TogetherCrew is researching how Web3 social networks behave, with a special emphasis on retaining new community members and community health.TogetherCrew is requesting read access to Arbitrum’s Discourse and Discord API to run an analysis with our partners (researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara) and present it to the community for research purposes.For clarity, this analysis ONLY uses data that is already publicly available. No private data will be collected. No data will be sold to third parties nor used without consent.This proposal also allows us to test Hivemind, a bot that reads public data from Discourse and Discord and allows community members to ask questions: e.g. “has anyone discussed the topic of Treasury management before?” or “What were the most common objections to proposals related to incentives?”.No budget is required as this research has already been funded through other sources (academic grants and previous Web3 grants from Aave, Aragon, Celo, Pocket Network and MetaCartel to develop the data pipelines, infrastructure, and previous research on community helath).MotivationOur understanding of Web3 social networks is still in its infancy. Studying the configuration of a social network and its impact on member retention could yield valuable insights to improve the resilience of Web3 communities.Additionally, the social network mapping analysis gives us a potential tool to identify high-context community members (e.g. a recent analysis of Optimism’s community enabled their community team to identify potential community ambassadors who had been missed). This analysis could be used to suggest members to invite to the offsite (non-binding, just as an exploratory analysis).SpecificationsWe care about data privacy. We only collect data that is already in the public domain (e.g. public discourse posts yes, but not the email addresses associated with their account). Feedback was provided by the Arbiturm Foundation on our privacy policy and terms of service.The solution is based on an (open-source) bot that will get read access to selected community platforms (for now Discourse and public channels in Discord). This bot has already been deployed in 100+ communities, including Optimism, Celo, Aave, Aragon, Shardeum, etc. The permissions are configured to be low-risk (no admin permission, no managing channels, etc. so even if the bot was hacked, the discord and discourse servers wouldn’t be compromised) and we have battle-tested for scalability and reliability.The analyses of the data are performed by the TogetherCrew team of scientists and our research partners at the University of California Santa Barbara. Those handling the data have undergone ethical data management training and could lose their academic credentials for unethical conduct.The architecture has been developed by our tech lead who’s ex-Accenture and built a data startup in the medical industry. So although the data we manage is low risk (no private data, only public handles, etc.) we’re still investing in data security progressively.We don’t use the data to train any AI models. Some analyses might use AI, in which case we favour open-source models that don’t feed on user data.Changes to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy:TogetherCrew currently has no changes planed, but should a change be planned, TogetherCrew will give a minimum of 2 weeks’ notice to the DAO, via a new proposal post, before such changes take effect. Thus allowing any delegate to submit a snapshot vote to suspend the service if desired.Steps to ImplementA favourable snapshot vote will give the foundation the permission to give us read access to the Discourse API and public Discord channels. No further actions are required. We’ll present our findings to the community (progressively over 1-3 months).Additionally, we’ll run a pilot of Hivemidn which uses this same data to answer community questions.BudgetNo budget requestedWe do hope in the future to develop additional functionalities communities would pay for. E.g.:In parnterhip with SingulairtyNET we’ve been developing Hivemind - an AI-powered Q&A bot that acts as a research assistant enabling community members to ask questions such as:“How do I participate in governance?”“Has anyone proposed something on topic XYZ?”“What was discussed last month while I was away”etc.And funded by the Arbitrum questbook program we’re also developing Dynamic Reputation NFTs, where members who desire to do so can mint their context score onchain. Thos who don’t desire it, don’t need to take any action, the NFTs are opt-in only.For now, the solution is made available free of charge.Had there been a previous proposal?We had posted about this some time ago but didn’t move forward with it. Now with the discussion around context we’re curious to explore that and see if we can provide a solution to the DAO.Community Health Analytics and reputation NFTs in ArbitrumDAO General    TogetherCrew (one of RnDAO’s incubated ventures) has developed a community analytics tool that can gather data from public conversations in Discord, Discourse (the forum), Github, etc etc. And more recently obtained a grant from ArbitrumDAO to develop Reputation NFTs. We’ll make the reputation NFTs to ArbitrumDAO contributors as a pilot and so this is a thread to raise awareness about the initiative and answer any questions.

This next stage emphasizes forging strong academic collaborations and strategic ecosystem partnerships, aiming to expand on its early achievements and establish a compelling narrative and strong growth-force for Arbitrum within the Latin American region.This second stage will run from June 2024 until September 2024.Growth Focused In the second stage of our project, our primary focus is on growth. We aim to broaden our impact across Latin America by strategically amplifying our evergreen content through social media channels. Following our Content & Social Media Strategy, we’ll engage Spanish-speaking audiences with informative and educational posts about Arbitrum. Simultaneously, we’re launching a dynamic Telegram community to facilitate discussions and provide timely updates.Moreover, we’re actively cultivating partnerships with influential Web3 communities and figures. Recently, we collaborated with Sheinix for a live session on YouTube, leveraging their 70k+ followers to extend our reach and share valuable insights within the ecosystem. These initiatives are crucial as we continue to strengthen Arbitrum’s presence and engagement in the region.Feel free to check our Content & Social Media Strategy for this second stage here.Academic Collaborations  A crucial aspect for generating real growth within the region is reaching audiences who are still outside the ecosystem and have not yet gone down the rabbit hole. This audience, this enormous mass of potential users, talents, and collaborators, is eager to learn, a sentiment we notice in every university we engage with. The story repeated itself time and again: students and professionals of all ages seek to educate themselves about the Web3 ecosystem, and in the face of lingering skepticism and suspicions surrounding the ecosystem, they see the academic environment as a “safe” place to do so.The Web3 community also has a growing need for professionals and talented individuals, and so there is genuine interest and synergy that deserves to be exploited for the benefit of all.Our educational focus in universities centers around Arbitrum and is delivered through tailored classes designed for the diverse audiences at different institutions. Currently, we have over 10 collaborations scheduled throughout 2024 with many of Argentina’s leading private and public educational institutions. Recently, we initiated an outreach program to establish partnerships with universities in Chile, Uruguay, and Colombia.On June 4th, a 2-hour in-person class was conducted at the International Finance Laboratory of UADE, detailed further below.

We later covered a wide range of technical aspects of Arbitrum, including the technologies behind it, such as optimistic rollups, the power of Arbitrum Nitro and AnyTrust, and products like Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and the Orbit chains. We also discussed exciting upcoming updates, including zk proofs and the Timeboost AIP.What can we expect in the coming months? The Arbitrum LATAM project will continue its operations until September 2024. What can be expected in the coming months? And what will happen afterward?More Content, More Collaborations The Arbitrum LATAM team is currently working on establishing new partnerships and collaborations with communities, organizations, and institutions to create a broader network of contacts over the coming months. These collaborations will help in disseminating created content, educating and acquiring new users, and increasing the overall exposure of Arbitrum as the leading brand and Layer 2 solution.While this will be the project’s main focus on this second stage, the team will continue to deliver on a monthly basis: Educative Articles, Informatives, Podcasts, Spaces, and Newsletters.The Arbitrum LATAM team has also received collaborative proposals from projects already launched (and those yet to launch) on Arbitrum. It is our intention to support these projects and guide them in the right direction through our educational and articulation efforts, aiming for healthy and organic growth of the ecosystem.Ambassadors Pre-Onboarding Course & Developer’s site A new proposal has been presented to the DevTooling Domain: The Pre-Onboarding Ambassador Course aims to create a solid base of educated and apt candidates for the Arbitrum Ambassador Program, in light of the Foundation’s acceptance of new ambassadors. This course is designed to thoroughly educate potential ambassadors about their roles, responsibilities, and the significant impact they can have within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Through a combination of comprehensive workshops and detailed guides, participants will gain a deep understanding of Arbitrum’s technical features and governance mechanisms. The workshops will cover essential topics such as developing smart contracts, designing DApps with Ethers.js, and integrating WalletConnect, ensuring that participants are well-equipped with practical skills and theoretical knowledge.Moreover, the course will include a badge system to incentivize participation and recognize achievements. Participants who complete all three workshops will earn digital badges, such as POAPs or NFTs, serving as credentials that showcase their acquired knowledge and skills. All workshops and guides will be available as evergreen content, providing the entire community with lasting educational resources. This initiative would not only enhance technical proficiency but also would prepare participants for meaningful contributions to the Arbitrum community, thereby fostering a robust and informed pool of ambassadors.You can check the full proposal here.Next Stage? A web3 project focused on brand growth, user acquisition, and project engagement requires continuous and fluid effort over time. Building a community for DeFi is significantly more challenging than in the TradFi world, due to natural knowledge barriers and the skepticism that still surrounds the web3 ecosystem.The Arbitrum LATAM team has so far collaborated with the Arbitrum protocol through Domain grants. However, the very nature of grants makes maintaining a consistent and smooth workflow over time difficult for a project of this scale.At the end of this current Stage 2, the team will produce a detailed and concise report on what Arbitrum LATAM has achieved during its initial months. Then, a new proposal will be presented to the DAO and its community to achieve greater impact and fully exploit the project’s potential over a more extended period of time."

We want to thank @cliffton.eth along with the rest of members of the AF for their collaboration with the project.The project will also try to secure an official subdomain for the www.arbitrumlatam.com website.Project will also work to improve and optimize the current website during March.Explore Potential New Uses for Current NetworksDuring March we’ll begin developing informative Podcast episodes in a new series for the platform.Also we’ll explore new ways of using the current communicational channels (such as Spotify and YouTube), including collaboration with other projects from the LATAM region, interviews to members of the DAO, coffee hours, and more.Investigate the Potential for Hosting an In-person Event in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaThis exploration will involve assessing venue options, estimating budget requirements, and identifying potential partners or collaborators for the event.This initiative would enable us to interact in person with the community we’re building. Also, this event could also attract attention from individuals outside the typical web3 niche through difussion in universities, thus broadening our reach and diversifying our audience.We aim to spark curiosity, inspire involvement, and foster a sense of belonging among attendees, ultimately strengthening our project’s impact and influence in the region.Development of a Survey for the LATAM CommunityIn the near future the project aims to conduct a survey to understand the Arbitrum community’s demographics and preferences. This survey will gather insights into the community’s age, country of origin, gender distribution, education level, employment status, income, and cryptocurrency usage.This data-driven approach will help the teams tailor the educational resources and outreach efforts effectively, fostering a more informed and engaged community around Arbitrum in Latin America."

This report highlights the activity of Season 2 of Questbook, starting from May 2024 to October 2024 and distributing $770,250 to applicants, with softcaps of up to $25,000 for an evaluation of a single DA and up to $50,000 for two DAs. All payments have been denominated in USDC.Note: while the initial proposal stated that, in case of ARB conversion of less than $1M per domain, we would have requested the differences to the DAO, after speaking with delegates we realized that there was no appetite for further spending. For this reason, the program has effectively been executed with 23% less of what was planned for.Domain OverviewNumber of Proposals: 106Number of proposals accepted: 29Total completed proposals: 11Total funds approved: 761,050$Total funds disbursed: 328,875$Total milestones: 104Total completed milestones: 46There have been a total of 106 proposals, of which only 29 were approved.image1016×594 101 KBThe bulk of all proposals, without including the category “Others”, are aboutDeFi (11.2%)AI (7.1%)Governance (7.1%).The outcome was quite expected: Arbitrum is still considered the DeFi King, and is reflected by the high number of proposals. If we also add the Dex, Trading and Lending, which de facto can be considered as sub-categories of DeFi, we jump to a whopping 23,4%. Basically, almost one proposal out of four has been about Decentralized Finance.The second category is Artificial Intelligence. This category includes a very heterogeneous set of proposals that put AI at the center. With the democratization of models, we are both classic applications which plug in AI, but also a full set of SDKs and environments to leverage the technology.Finally we have Governance. The Arbitrum chain is the home of DeFi, but the Arbitrum DAO is the most important DAO out there for the governance processes, and this is reflected by the proposals coming in. We have plenty of Governance tooling proposals, framework for proposals, apps to track the life cycle of proposals etcetera.image1252×736 98.9 KBFor the approved proposals, the main categories have beenDeFi (10%)Other (10%)Governance (10%).This classification partially matches the one of all presented proposals, with a big difference: the “AI” category has been replaced with the “Other” one. The other includes all of the proposals that don’t have a specific classification, and could partially be interpreted as “experimentation” even though this is not always the case. This choice was a conscious one, because one of the goals of the Questbook program has always been the diversity; at the same time, we have seen how AI has been lately abused, and plugged in products that might not necessarily benefit from it. Up to some degree, proposals with embedded AI mechanics were, sometimes, the ones in which the team might have reflected the less about PMF.image1266×738 77 KBWhat could be interesting to analyze is the amount requested by each proposal. In this Questbook season 2, we introduced a soft cap up to 25,000$ with an evaluation of just one domain allocator, and a soft cap up to 50,000$ with an evaluation of two domain allocators.A lot of teams tried their luck by not requesting the evaluation of two domain allocators, and this is why we see the bulk of the proposals between 20,000$ to 30,000$: most of them are at 25,000$ or below. At the same time, we have a higher amount of requests above 40,000$ compared to the ones between 30,000$ to 40,000$: it’s very clear that the team that needed more funds, tried to go for the maximum available.In this domain, but also in the others, the DA pushed on all proposals to cut, when possible, spending, both to avoid a situation of creating just two naturally clustering tickets (25,000 and 50,000$), but also as a consequence of the lower amount of funds available in the program compared to what was initially planned.It has been pretty clear how increasing the cap has unlocked a new wave of teams that weren’t able to tap into a program that was, in season 1, not big enough. It is also an attestation of how Questbook season 2 was designed as gap filler for the Arbitrum Foundation grant program, to cover that range up to 50,000$ for smaller financing of projects.Summary of the 29 accepted proposalsImprove the Discoverability of Projects Receiving Growth Incentives Using FairAILink to the proposal: Fair ProtocolFunding Approved for: 20,000 USDMilestones completed: 2/2Reason for Approval as DA: The proposal aims to fill one of the gaps in our DAO—marketing—through the use of AI. While it is not necessarily revolutionary, the plan to integrate the bot with data for the upcoming incentive programs (STIP.b and LTIPP, ready to start in a few weeks) and the willingness to work with potential future initiatives (such as the 404 DAO marketing that unfortunately didn’t went through, or others in future) means that a project with potential average value can elevate itself to something more significant for both the team and the Arbitrum ecosystem.This type of composability, the idea of plugging into the current context rather than an abstract one, is what teams should aim for to truly find product-market fit (PMF).Utoken appLink to the proposal: Utoken appFunding Approved for: 14,500 USDMilestones completed: 3/3Reason for Approval as DA: While the application is not revolutionary, it is indeed solid. It can give people the ability to directly pay for bills and, potentially in the future, other goods through crypto, in specific African regions. This adds utility, removes friction, and enhances real use cases, especially in developing countries where traditional banking systems are not widely available.The team is complete and has previously worked on and delivered other projects successfully. Adding Telegram integration will provide even more access. Considering the amount requested, it is fair and appropriate to grant the funding.StationX on ArbitrumLink to the proposal: StationX on ArbitrumFunding Approved for: 24,000 USDMilestones completed: 3/3Reason for Approval as DA: The application is fairly straightforward. The team wants to deploy a set of functionalities in Arbitrum (KYC for stations, spaces, and integration with some DeFi protocols) that have already been deployed on other chains.The idea is to democratize participation in ventures, making them accessible to a broader set of users. This aligns well with the ethos of crypto, where reducing friction not only enhances user experience compared to traditional finance but also opens up more opportunities.The team is well-versed in their product, having iterated on it for a couple of years, and they are expanding across several chains. Given the team’s proven track record and the alignment of their idea with crypto culture, it is worth pursuing.Automated Reputation Scoring Platform Based on On-Chain Arbitrum ActivityLink to the proposal: Automated Reputation Scoring Platform Based on On-Chain Arbitrum Activity [New]Funding Approved for: 20,000 USDMilestones completed: 2/2Reason for Approval as DA: Reputation systems are gaining more traction over time. They have been around for a while, with usage typically limited to specific tasks. The hope is that with public goods like this, we will see increased integration of wallet reputation into core systems and dApps in general.The idea is not necessarily novel, but it is well executed and robust, especially since the product will be a public good. The team has a solid track record that inspires confidence, and the founder has been very persistent in pursuing this grant. While the latter point is not necessarily within the scope of evaluation, driven founders are always a good indication of potential success.For these reasons, we are awarding the grant to this proposal, hoping that the outcome will be a solid product usable by all Arbitrum users.Sonica: Empowering RWA Tokenization with Arbitrum IntegrationLink to the proposal: Sonica: Empowering RWA Tokenization with Arbitrum IntegrationFunding Approved for: 18,000 USDMilestones completed: 2/2Reason for Approval as DA: This is an application that is not necessarily groundbreaking but is very solid. If well executed, it can effectively tap into several addressable market pockets that are currently not exploited. Combining Web2, Web3, tokenization, and RWA (real-world assets) could either be an exercise in style or something quite useful. If this is the evaluation, why is the application approved?Because the Sonica team is approaching it in the right way, specifically through well-known Web2 methods: integration through API, security-oriented practices, and no-code solutions. These are characteristics that are essential in corporate reality when you want to start an integration with a new partner.If a tokenization, no-code platform is going to work effectively, the above is a robust and solid plan.The team was also able to reduce their request by almost 30%, which I highly appreciate.Collabberry: Compensation for early stage teams with On-chain Project PointsLink to the proposal: Collabberry: Compensation for early stage teams with On-chain Project PointsFunding Approved for: 20,000 USDMilestones completed: 2/5Reason for Approval as DA: Collabberry presents an innovative approach to improving compensation models by addressing the pitfalls of existing solutions like Coordinape. The team has support from RnDAO and experienced members, though some team members are unspecified, indicating potential gaps in experience. This is effectively the biggest risk, but the idea is novel enough to warrant taking this risk.The proposal is thorough, with clear objectives and detailed problem identification. The timeline and goals are feasible due to the team’s understanding of the product.Interesting to note is that, probably, on another chain this product would not have the same value it has here. Arbitrum DAO is demonstrating, for better or worse, to be one of the most decentralized entities in the crypto world. Collabberry can indeed have a role as a tool for small and mid-sized teams, and potentially more in the future, to alleviate the issues of payment in what is effectively a horizontal world.Complete Analytics of All Arbitrum NFTs on DegenzLink to the proposal: Complete Analytics of All Arbitrum NFTs on DegenzFunding Approved for: 20,000 USDMilestones completed: 3/3Reason for Approval as DA: This is a project that is not very innovative but is solid.As we all know, NFTs are a pain point in Arbitrum; they are also an asset class that has been almost forgotten by the market for now. However, forgetting doesn’t mean they won’t have a resurgence at some point. When that happens, we want to be ready in Arbitrum, infrastructure-wise. Degenz offers a very good platform, detail-oriented on NFTs and other topics of interest such as Friend Tech.While it could be argued that the platform itself might not be totally focused on a single asset class or might lack a specific identity, there is indeed good work behind it, with a community of several tens of thousands on Twitter and very good informative dashboards. For this reason, financing an NFT dashboard specifically for Arbitrum feels like a good investment of resources because the experience of the team and the fact that they have been running their business for a few years significantly lowers the related risks.DexPal.aiLink to the proposal: DexPal.aiFunding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 3/3Reason for Approval as DA: The proposal of DexPal is for a “good old DeFi analytical platform.” While Arbitrum is still largely the land of DeFi, we haven’t seen many of these types of proposals in Questbook lately, with folks wanting to experiment with more novel projects. So there was some curiosity to see an application that was a dashboard to aggregate perps.There was a big difference between the initial application and the demo witnessed on a call. The proposal was a bit poor, but the demo was impressive, to the point that I advised the team to level up their ability in writing decks and materials for future investors.It was surprising to see a platform similar to Oku, another DeFi platform oriented toward Uniswap and pool management/liquidity/swaps. Despite these important differences, the two applications are quite similar and face similar challenges: aggregating several sources (for Oku, pools; for DexPal, exchanges/perps), showing users specific data from these different sources, fetching a large amount of data, etc.DexPal is on track to create a very good dApp that could potentially be key in the future of Arbitrum if they play their cards right. We couldn’t find a way to fit more developments into this specific proposal, but this grant is also preparatory for a future raise and to showcase abilities to investors. It can really be a good flywheel for the project.Station XLink to the proposal: StationX on ArbitrumFunding Approved for: 24,000 USDMilestones completed: 3/3Reason for Approval as DA: The application is pretty straightforward: the team wants to bring to Arbitrum a set of features (KYC for stations, spaces, plus integration with some DeFi protocols) they’ve already rolled out on other chains. The idea is to open up participation in ventures; basically, it’s about making certain investments more accessible to a wider group of users. This fits well with the crypto ethos - it’s not just about making things smoother than traditional finance for everyday use, but also about creating more opportunities.The team knows their product inside out, having worked on it for a couple of years now, and they’re expanding to various chains. It’s worth backing because of the team’s quality and proven track record, and because the idea aligns with crypto culture.Locale NetworkLink to the proposal: Locale NetworkFunding Approved for: 35,000 USDMilestones completed: 4/4Reason for Approval as DA: This was a complex application to evaluate, and also required the help of a second domain allocator, in this case SeedLatam, for the evaluation.The application wants to allow loans utilizing E-TRAN scores for evaluation, and wants to reduce the friction an SMB can have in the rural portion of the country where the banks don’t provide this service due to lack of profitability. The idea of the team is to plug in crypto as a way to tap in liquidity.The application, initially, was about the team getting their own license, building the infra, getting all the regulatory papers and stamps needed and bootstrap the protocol. But, unfortunately, there were a few risks for the program, namely the potential regulation risk and time risk to deliver. There was easily the chance of having compliance issues, or just others that can happen in any venture, and this would have not been compatible with the time horizon of 6 months of the program. We had to downscale the proposal a bit, namely on the team utilizing already existing financial infrastructure instead of directly pursuing their own during this specific grant.The result is quite satisfying: the proposal is novel, is a bridge of 2 worlds (financial for small business and crypto), tries to tackle a problem that exist (rural areas not being served by certain financial services), and has a novel mechanism (loan terms adjusted based on real world scoring, specifically of usa business).Arbitrum DeFi DollarLink to the proposal: Arbitrum DeFi Dollar - An Arbitrum Stablecoin Data HubFunding Approved for: 24,050 USDMilestones completed: 0/4Reason for Approval as DA: In my knowledge there is currently no dashboard, in arbitrum showing this info: the amount of stables being provided, and being lent, in the chain, alongside the costs. This dashboard can for sure be interesting, especially because it is developed as public good, by a team that has some names with experience in lending protocols such as AAVE.It perfectly fits the narrative of Arbitrum as the home of DeFi, and could potentially be an inspiration for others to fork it or iterate on top of it to create further informational services and dashboard.It also has some very logical criterias on why a certain protocol, or a certain stable, should be included in the dashboard itself.All-in-one management Tool for delegatesLink to the proposal: All-in-one management Tool for delegatesFunding Approved for: 38,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/5Reason for Approval as DA: For the sake of disclosure, it is necessary to explain how SeedLatam is one of the members of this grant program, for the domain “Education, Community Growth and Events”. But also, SeedLatam is a big organization, spanning from governance to event to running nodes and other ventures; for this reason, and because the people involved in Questbook program were not the ones involved in this very proposal, we evaluated that there was no conflict of interest nor any specific issue in SeedLatam presenting a grant request for a project, that was evaluated by me and the DA of Dev Tooling, Juandi.The proposal wants to build a governance tool to make life easier for all DAO. In Arbitrum we are seeing an exponential growth in the amount of participants, thanks also to the Delegate Incentive Program, and this is also reflected in the amount of proposals drafted and published first in the forum, and then in snapshot/tally.Even just for these reasons, creating a standardized framework with integrations on the currently used tools and data, such as pulling actual proposals, up to create a ““delegate dashboard””, and potentially beyond, is something worth pursuing and financing. Knowing that Seed doesn’t just theorize on these topics but has hands directly in the governance matters, I suspect the final tool will be something not only usable, but used by most professional delegates.AlphadayLink to the proposal: Arbitrum Dashboard on AlphadayFunding Approved for: 2,000 USDMilestones completed: 3/3Reason for Approval as DA: This proposal is something new in Questbook in the sense that is, effectively, a retrogrant for a big portion of the product.The dashboard, with a focus on Arbitrum news, videos and a lot of other material, is already available, and I have to say is already quite enjoyable. The proposal wants to also make it better through the addition of job posting, governance news and others.For the amount requested, and for the quality of the product, this approval was quite easy. And again, is a bit out of scope being, partially, a retrogrant, but looking at the product and looking at what the team has overall realized, is likely positive for the dao to finance this project.GonanaLink to the proposal: Gonana MarketplaceFunding Approved for: 15,000 USDMilestones completed: 3/3Reason for Approval as DA: This proposal taps into the creation of an agricultural marketplace leveraging blockchain technology. It tries to address specific issues in the African region regarding putting in communication distributors with farmers, in a way that is transparent, open and fair. Through the marketplace, and with escrow contracts, the stakeholders will be able to sell/buy, and also put forward bids and asks, agricultural products, thus removing communication and other barriers. The proposal also wants to implement an educational part, with video content, to allow users to properly understand how to use the platform.I was initially on the fence on this application, especially because I wasn’t sure how it would get traction and a decent amount of user base if any. The grantee explained during the interview that they have a relationship with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), which currently has contacts with 15k farmers that they are profiling, which is a potential good start.This, more than a grant, is a bet on the questbook side: it’s quite risky because, due to the nature of the protocol, and how it is entangled with specific economics and politics of the Nigerian region, a lot of things can go wrong and would result in an unsuccessful grant. But also, this is the type of grant that, from a usage standpoint, is quite asymmetric: if it works, we can have an application that can potentially change a lot of lives for the best.SongLink to the proposal: SONGS | Open Music Distribution ProtocolFunding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 2/2Reason for Approval as DA: This proposal was initially rejected not because of the idea, but for the gaps in the team members. Let’s start with what the application wants to do: solve the problem of royalties with NFT in the music industry. Effectively my initial reaction was ““why should we try to tackle a model, the royalty one, that so far has seen a play of cat and mouse around it””. Then, after re-reading the application, it was more clear that it was not about the royalty problem per se, but about evolving and adapting a tool (the NFT) to a media (the music), by putting together upgradable metadata, ownership and others. It is, indeed, a step forward likely in the right direction; even if it would not lead to what effectively the future will be for this industry and erc, is likely an experiment worth taking.The initial team was composed of only two persons, one with a lot of heterogeneous skills including technical ones, and another with verticals in the music industry. This was the reason for the initial rejection: lack of designers and front end developers, and of other figures, made the risk of not delivering what was promised in the grant program just too high. My initial evaluation, as exception to the usual rules applies, was to come back with a more complete team and, effectively, this is what happened. This not only makes me happy, but shows the commitment of the team in pursuing the route of the grant program in Arbitrum through questbook.SimplrLink to the proposal: Simplr Events - Verifiable and trustless secondary ticket marketplaceFunding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/3Reason for Approval as DA: My initial approach to the Simplr application was a bit biased: we have seen plenty of applications regarding the usage of web3 technologies to tackle the inequalities and inefficiencies of secondary ticket markets. I have to say, the team was able to change my mind.The team in his application was able to show how they effectively conducted studies on the ground capable of making this application at least potentially oriented toward success. Their partnership with events, to convert tickets from LuMa and eventbrite to NFT, was indeed one of the infinite ways in which you would validate the flow of information and UI from a user standpoint, as well as the test directly with smaller events.How solid their approach is, and the fact that the team, after submission, worked for 2 months to find a BD lead (which is extremely needed in a protocol like this) convinced me to move forward in the grant despite the initial biases.EmberAILink to the proposal: Ember AI - Conversational DeFi for discoverability and actions on the goFunding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/5Reason for Approval as DA: The idea behind Ember AI is interesting: utilize AI and a custom widget to be able to interact with DeFi protocols, in a way that is somehow similar to what we are used to in Web2 applications; the team specifically mentions, for example, stripe.The spin of a very custom and deep integration of AI into DeFi model is something potentially quite good to improve UX; at the same time, the main issue is the scalability of the project, since for every new protocol we require to have not only a custom widget, that maybe would also require a look & feel similar to the protocols on top of which the integration is done, but also a deep study and understanding of the dynamics.I think it is worth financing this application, because it would be a great first iteration on trying to improve UX, one of the main missions that we currently have as an industry.SecuwaLink to the proposal: Secuwa - Self custody savings for retail users.Funding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 3/4Reason for Approval as DA: This project is quite straightforward: give users the ability to move capital from bank accounts to crypto (through chain abstraction) thus obtaining a higher yield for their savings.The idea is simple but solid because it relies on using QoL technology, such as account abstraction, a mobile first experience, and battle tested protocols like AAVE and Uniswap. For this reason I think the project is worth pursuing: it will effectively onboard people to crypto without them almost knowing, will provide a frictionless experience to use some of the most famous protocols, and will serve as a bridge to enhance liquidity in the ecosystem.The experience of the team is such that they can achieve PMF with this application.PrimisLink to the proposal: Primis Protocol - Gaming infra on ArbitrumFunding Approved for: 36,000 USDMilestones completed: 2/4Reason for Approval as DA: This project was quite complex to evaluate: it puts together staked assets, bonding, decentralized infra for gaming, and a B2B approach.Users will be able to deposit LRT assets; these will be bonded, and users will be for example rewarded through the native token of the protocol. At the same time, the yield generated will be used to pay for infrastructure for gaming such as servers that can be used by web3 games. Over time the protocol will evolve into an orbit chain settling on Arbitrum. The main customers of this protocol will not be players but directly web3 companies that need a solid partner for their infrastructure.This is an extremely ambitious project, one worth in our opinion financing to see the outcome, especially now that Arbitrum wants to establish itself as the home of games through initiatives such as GCP; a proposal like this one is a perfect fit in this environment.Dream ProtocolLink to the proposal: Dream ProtocolFunding Approved for: 24,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/3Reason for Approval as DA: The proposal comes from the team behind Knights Of The Ether, a well established game that was born in Arbitrum.Idea is to get AI, a topic that is extremely trendy right now in every platform (including Questbook), to create something with real value and utility. Dream protocol currently allows users to create art for 2D cards to which they will attach mechanics. The most popular ones by votes will be then used in the game Blightfell. The proposal is about extending these capabilities to any type of asset, for any game, deployed in Arbitrum or in Orbit chains.I am indeed excited about this proposal, because it is about streamlining the working capabilities of a team by reducing the amount of load on certain tasks. The tool will also not be gated, will have a front end for easiness of usage for external parties, will be capable to host media and files from users, and will also be used, at least initially, not in a SaaS type of model but to gather info and insight on what users and protocols wants and likely to also better train the model. This approach is in general the type that we want in any grant, because it doesn’t look specifically to monetization, but has an approach with the goal of scaling and growing the product first in a way that has value and utility.I am extremely curious to see what this tool will be in 6 months from now.ArbitrumDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard - CurialabLink to the proposal: ArbitrumDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard - CurialabFunding Approved for: 40,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/8Reason for Approval as DA: This application has had quite a run, first being presented directly to the DAO and failing a snapshot, and then moving to Questbook. In here we were able to work with the Curia team together to understand how we could potentially make it be a better fit for both this program and the ecosystem. In the end, there was not too much to change in terms of content: the platform is quite good, Curia is also an extremely experienced delegate and team, and the work they are doing in other DAOs is of high quality.Their alignment to our core values is definitely here, and there is an intrinsic importance for these initiatives in Arbitrum now with the upcoming staking proposal that will indeed make governance even more important than what it is now. Furthermore, the team was able to trim 20% of their initial request to better fit in a program that is extremely oversubscribed. The amount requested for a customized platform, and 6 months of report and analysis on governance, is definitely a fair amount.StormbitLink to the proposal: StormbitFunding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/3Reason for Approval as DA: In the Stormbit protocol the idea is to leverage data fetched through Reclaim protocol to create a p2p lending platform with specific terms.The goal is to have custom loans, based on both onchain and offchain information and scoring, that can be evaluated by the counterparty, with these scoring being verified through ZK proofs. This means effectively a high degree of customization, such as integration of hooks, permissioned pools, optional kyc and others.The plan is effectively interesting since the composability opens up to experimentation that can likely lead to useful results, such as: how can we build alternative lending platforms that can find PMF in crypto, what specific implementations these platforms should have, etcetera.The project, I have to say, is extremely risky, in the sense it could potentially have either a huge success, or none, or anything in between, but is worth financing for the experimentation.Virtual Event: Revolutionising Academic Credentialing with BlockchainLink to the proposal: ""Virtual Event: Revolutionising Academic Credentialing with Blockchain.Funding Approved for: 9,500 USDMilestones completed: 1/2Reason for Approval as DA: The proposal aims to put academic credentials on chain through NFT.There is indeed an enormous TAM to address with an initiative like this, but this market could be created only through experiments like this one, because standardization of credentials and interoperability will be key, and NFT is just one of the multiple ways in which this could be achieved.What is good about this proposal is not only the budget, relatively small, but also that the team is already in contact with educational institutions and will have a milestone approach including the integration in pilot universities. This to me is key, because it makes the proposal not just an academic/research one, but something with a practical impact and data to study for the future.The combination of not so costly economics, utility and real application makes this an easy yes.zkVerify - zk-proof verification system for ArbitrumLink to the proposal: zkVerify zk-proof verification system for ArbitrumFunding Approved for: 40,000 USDMilestones completed: 0/5Reason for Approval as DA: The zkVerify proposal focuses on enabling apps on Arbitrum to use zk proof technologies. It offers a dedicated zk-proof generation and verification layer to reduce the time and cost of zk-proof operations, making them faster and more affordable, and presents potential use cases like private voting, identity verification, and decentralized games.The good thing is that we are talking about a protocol that has been on live testnet since March 2024, with already concrete plans for a full mainnet launch. The grant request would not only support the design of the protocol, but also implementation and promotion. Latter seems important due to how key zk technology seems to be (according to much smarter people than me like Vitalik), and how we should push it along in Arbitrum to compete against chains that have their core value in the zk integration.I don’t think this could have come from a team with more experience than Horizen Labs, the team behind not only zkVerify but also Apechain.QuantAMMLink to the proposal: QuantAMM.fiFunding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 0/3Reason for Approval as DA: The QuantAMM application is a “classic” DeFi type of proposal. Ironically, we haven’t seen too many DeFi proposals in this season of Questbook.The team wants to bring traditional quant strategies on blockchain, starting with a very basic one such as a Macd strategy based on which you would go long or short an asset based on the specific readings of a technical indicator. What is really interesting tho is that all computation is done onchain, which makes not only the application interesting for the idea but also for the implementation.The macd is a first of a potential infinite set of strategies that we should see live over time. While simple, it will be easy enough for people to understand and a good PoC for the whole product. And hopefully we will see more advanced strategies from traditional and quantitative finance coming in this world.Proposal.appLink to the proposal: Arbitrum Proposals App – Showcasing the Full Lifecycle of an Arbitrum ProposalFunding Approved for: 43,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/4Reason for Approval as DA: The Arbitrum Proposals App represents a good advancement in governance infrastructure for the Arbitrum ecosystem. By consolidating the entire lifecycle of proposals, from initial forum discussions to on-chain execution, this tool addresses a significant gap in the current governance process. Effective governance is so important for the Arbitrum ecosystem and for its growth, and this application will definitely help delegates and voters with comprehensive and easily accessible information. The unified view of proposal data will help the decision making process: one of the most difficult things is effectively to track how a proposal has evolved over time, and this transparency will fill the gap in the information asymmetry between delegates extremely entrenched versus newer ones. The project’s commitment to open-source development, and its positioning as a public good, align with the ethos of decentralization. Giving a grant to this tool is an investment in the quality of Arbitrum’s governance, and also supports our DAO activity since this application was the winner of GovHack in Bruxelles.ĀutOSLink to the proposal: ĀutOS (by Āut Labs)Funding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 1/2Reason for Approval as DA: The proposal wants to iterate upon the concept of RepFi, Reputation Finance. This idea has been explored in several ways and is still currently under experiment, with no standardization inside but also some overlap with online identities. Is definitely a use case in which crypto will remove friction compared to traditional venues and financial systems and should be worth exploring.What is interesting about this application is that it is extremely model oriented, built upon a math model more than specific desired outcome. The main hurdle I see here is then translating the model into something that, UX wise, is enjoyable for users, plus the fact that the current grant covers only a part of the application (it was initially a way larger request).Despite this, it is worth pursuing for the very robust underneath approach, plus there is an embedded modularity that alongside the mentioned model will help it likely to scale fast if it has success.Extremely interesting experiment, to me done in the right way, and very asymmetric in results if it succeeds.Incentive Distributions / Verifiability - A different spin towards UALink to the proposal: Incentive Distributions / Verifiability - A different spin towards UAFunding Approved for: 45,000 USDMilestones completed: 0/3Reason for Approval as DA: Clique’s proposal for automated attestations through TEE integration can definitely help the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem. Their past adventure with the Arbitrum Arcade, which engaged over 15000 unique addresses in 22 games, demonstrates their ability to scale projects effectively. They initially got a grant from the foundation, and iterated on top of this. There are a few key learnings that they are addressing such as limited claim windows and user friction, and so they aim to abstract the attestation process from end-users. Their plan to integrate with 5-10 top Arbitrum-aligned games and create a custom rewards system based on gaming data is consistent with an evolution, and a grant, that is basically doubling down on a success story started through the AF grants. Integrating Steam data (so web2) and Web3 gaming data is likely a small but needed initial step to a more omni comprehensive integration of gaming outside of crypto, which could for sure be leveraged in future. This project has the potential to create a more interconnected and data enriched gaming environment, and is worth financing to keep it moving as a key infra of a vertical that is quite important in our ecosystem.Wavy NodesLink to the proposal: Wavy NodeFunding Approved for: 23,125 USDMilestones completed: 1/7Reason for Approval as DA: This proposal has been extremely interesting to evaluate.The team wants to create a public good platform security oriented, to be able to create alerts in case of exploit or other hack for specific protocols, and they plan to also grow into providing services for traditional finance platforms.During the interview, they were capable to answer questions on how they would manage alerts without creating potential damage to the CT community through false positive (answer: attacks detected and notified to protocols in an automated fashion, but manually reviewed before going public on socials), or how they would scale the platform with several more protocols (answer: modularity of architecture through micro services).For an application like this, you also need experience and history in the security field, and the team has it. Overall both the idea and the fact that it is a public good makes the grant quite easy to approve.Echo LabLink to the proposal: Echo LabFunding Approved for: 25,000 USDMilestones completed: 0/4Reason for Approval as DA: Echo Lab’s proposal for a multi-chain DeFi copy trading platform is interesting. The team’s background in algorithmic trading is quite a fit, and their idea on how to integrate AI driven signals for trading could offer a new approach to both automated trading and to the usage of a technology, AI, that right now is put everywhere, almost it was a label to get a traction on a project. The application was refined by the team after the feedback, and they were quite receptive about how to change: this is always good, and is a lot of time a proxy of teams capable of understanding feedback from the market as well. The budget seems reasonable, and allocates a portion of the capital to a security audit which is always a must have more than a nice to have nowadays. Overall, the proposal shows a solid, good old DeFi application, worth a grant and worth the experiment."

Summary
This proposal moves 220,000,000 ARB from the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) multisig to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. This will leave 3,650,000 ARB for the GCP to continue operations until needing to seek a transfer of more funds from governance. It is unconscionable to continue to allow a 3/5 multisig hold $120M in ARB when they have failed to meet their agreed on oversight obligations.
Motivation


It is less safe to leave such large amounts of funding ","GCP Fund Security Review & OversightSummaryThis proposal moves 220,000,000 ARB from the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) multisig to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. This will leave 3,650,000 ARB for the GCP to continue operations until needing to seek a transfer of more funds from governance. It is unconscionable to continue to allow a 3/5 multisig hold $120M in ARB when they have failed to meet their agreed on oversight obligations.MotivationIt is less safe to leave such large amounts of funding in a multisig than in the DAO treasury. There is no demonstrable need for more than $120,000,000 of funding to be immediately available and controlled by a 3-of-5 multisig, which also puts those signers at risk of phishing or physical danger.It was a lot of work by a lot of people to pass GCP. So it’s a shame its council has not fulfilled its duties thus far and been tardy on meeting multiple of its oversight and transparency commitments that were ratified in the original proposal.This provides a path for GCP to continue with its full operating funds and an opportunity to prove the viability of its investment thesis, while removing the security risks associated with the multisig and the governance risks of limited oversight.Gaming Catalyst ProgressSince GCP was passed on June 10 (Now more than 4 months ago) it has spent 1,699,998 ARB.In August  Co-Auther of GCP, Karel, stepped down as Treasure has abandoned Arbitrum. GCP was passed with the understanding that Karel would be helping to lead it.Then in September, GCP Working Group nominated council member Andrew Green stepped down as well.The GCP is already significantly behind schedule, and the DAO deserves more guarantees that it can get on track. Grants applications and RFPs were supposed to open up by July, as seen in the original proposal, but none have been according to the update thread. More relevant to this proposal, however, is late delivery or nondelivery of transparency and oversight items promised in the GCP structure:The two council members appointed by the working group were supposed to be reconfirmed in September. In a June meeting summary pre-dating that communication, this reconfirmation was stated as being end of the year. Regardless of which communication was intended to be accurate, in the ratified proposal, Phase 2: Program Development (2-4 months) directs this reconfirmation no later than 4 months, which would be October 10, 2024. No confirmations have taken place, but the working group did appoint a new council member to replace a retiring member on October 3.The required quarterly transparency report has not been published. September 10, 2024 was one quarter since the approval of GCP.EDIT: It has been pointed out that the original GCP post proposed the first transparency report would be posted 4-6 months on, which we’re currently in. I dont agree with this approach but you could interpret this as they have more time to complete the first one.The most recent official update came about a month ago, and is limited to announcing the resignation of Andrew Green. Council meetings were to be held every two weeks in the ratified proposal. It is unclear if there are meetings without summary reports or if the cadence of meetings has changed - no notes have been shared if so. Only three meeting summaries have been provided, with two of them in June before permanent council members were elected.These were the agreed on outcomes for 2-4 months, which we are now past:screenshot of original GCP proposal work that should be completed by now.1582×826 119 KBAfter spending ~$800k in operation we have no RFP live, no Open Grants for game devs, and no published onboarding process for funded projects.GCP is not on track and not meeting its obligations to the DAO. $120M USD is far too massive of an investment for the GCP council to be this far behind.EDIT: GCP councilmembers have said The GCP council will be coming to the DAO in the coming days to formalize a start date for the program. I’m looking forward to it and will not pursue the rest of the actions here if we can quickly get back on track and post these updates publicly. Without any public updates posted in the update thread, I have no other official source of information to go on about how close they are to hitting the 4-month goals.Proposal SummaryTo help governance enforce compliance with GCP’s approved transparency and oversight responsibilities, moving the bulk of the funding back to the treasury will ensure the GCP cannot go dark or quietly forget its reporting obligations while still having access to more than $100m in funds. It will also ensure governance is aware of the cadence of spending and offer the opportunity to ask questions prior to any outsized funding requests being approved.This proposal would leave the GCP with almost $2m in funds to continue operations until it demonstrates a need to deploy more funding.SpecificationTransfer 220,000,000 ARB from 0xAe8cBcef7DE8664C3fF5BfC58536c183FfA60B51 back to the DAO Treasury at 0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58. This does not change the total authorized budget for GCP or alter any other portion of the proposal.If the proper reports are not made immediately to the DAO then I will next propose to fully claw back the funds for the DAO and remove the authorized budget.FeedbackPlease respond with feedback. I want to make sure every voice is heard on this as its a huge sum of capital and deploying it transparently is important to inspiring confidence in Arbitrum. We feel this strikes a valuable compromise that will satisfy GCP supporters because it does not affect GCP’s mandate or authorized budget, but will also soothe the fears of critics who see the early nondelivery of transparency items as proof GCP is not professionalized enough to handle this level of funding.It’s darkest before the dawn."

The 225M ARB tokens approved by the DAO for the creation of the GCP are currently in the custody of The Arbitrum Foundation, as outlined in the proposal. The $180k payout for multi-sig signers mentioned in the Tally proposal is not applicable, as neither the Foundation nor any of the signers are receiving compensation for custody of the funds.b. From the approval of the GCP program on June 10, 2024 there have been two transfers totaling 1,350,000 ARB tokens (majority equivalent in USDC, except the payments outlined at point (a) below) to the GCP Foundation in order to accommodate the following expenses: (a) payment of the proposal authors and contributors, as outlined in the proposal; (b) interim compensation for the working group for the months of June - September 2024 while the GCP Foundation is still being set-up and the final compensation for the GCP team is being negotiated; (c) GCP Council fees, as outlined in the Tally proposal; (d) other operational expenses such as payment for a compensation analyst, fees for setting up the entity etc. As of October 15, 2024, it’s important to note that the GCP Foundation still holds a significant portion of these funds since more expenses are anticipated such as insurance, legal fees etc.In addition to the above, we want to take this opportunity to highlight changes to the GCP Foundation’s governance framework that are necessary to protect the interests of the DAO.Vesting Requirement. In the GCP proposal, there is no vesting requirement for the ARB allocated for investment and grant activities. The Arbitrum Foundation will work with the GCP Foundation in order to implement a form of capital call or vesting, similar to how The Arbitrum Foundation itself is operating in order to ensure long-term alignment, in line with the program’s expectations. The Arbitrum Foundation has been working with the GCP Working Group, the Interim Transparency Committee and the GCP Council on this and details will be released in the following weeks.Arbitrum Foundation Observer Seat. The Arbitrum Foundation will have a permanent Observer seat on the GCP Council. The Observer can participate in all GCP Council discussions and have access to the same level of information, but it is a non-voting position and this role is not compensated at all.Exclude Treasury from Governance. All tokens held by the GCP Foundation were excluded from governance participation, as seen here. Any tokens distributed via agreements to future grantees or investees will be permitted to be used in governance by the respective recipients.DAO Controlled Wallet for Proceeds. Any upside from grants or any proceeds generated from investments will be sent to a smart contract controlled by the ArbitrumDAO. The GCP Council can make a request to the ArbitrumDAO on whether the funds can be re-used for further ecosystem activities in the future. GCP Foundation cannot reinvest any potential profits without DAO approval. Note, a portion of the upside will be retained by the GCP Foundation, to facilitate long-term incentive alignment with a profit share. More details related to the profit share (also referred to as carry or promote for funds) will be released shortly to the DAO by the GCP Council.The above changes are purely additive to the Tally proposal and there are no breaking changes with regards to what was in the proposal. The changes will also be publicly available to the DAO via the GCP Foundation’s Bylaws that are currently being worked on and will be published when finished."

Certain assumptions I made about core components were wrong, certain parameters were not reached.But to quote Rocky - “It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.”So with that said, let me run you through what happened in this experiment.I’ll start with what went wrong, how we pivoted, and finally, what went right.What went wrongTo recap, our experiment involved using our software, HoloNET, to port a game project through to Holochain, instead of AWS.After integrating Stellar Gate with HoloNET, we hit a block:AWS has a feature called SignalR, a library for ASP.NET that enables real-time web functionality in applications, allowing server-side code to push content to connected clients instantly. In the context of AWS SignalR facilitates real-time communication in web applications hosted on AWS infrastructure.Holochain also utilises Signals - but, due to the difference in Holochain’s distributed architecture we found it is not yet sufficiently developed for real time web functionality. Consequently our ‘experiment’ phase of the grant produced a negative result.How we pivotedAt this point, we asked ourselves three questions:1 - What can we do NOW, given the existing restrictions?2- What can we do NEXT, to remove the restrictions?3- How can we ensure that no matter what, this experiment is a win for Arbitrum as a whole?1 - What can we do NOWWe built a HoloNET API to load + save JSON data to Holochain, easilygithub.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-client-csharpAdded new HoloNETAPI project abstracting away yet more hc complexity into a simple data, signals and validation API... more to come soon! ;-)        committed 09:34PM - 10 Sep 24 UTC          dellams        +264-11This will be used as the foundations of the upcoming HoloNET HyperNET bringing P…2P to gaming! :)Why:Just as photographs came before film - while we can’t currently provide ‘real time functionality’, we can take a snapshot, and build from there. This API can be called at the end of the game, to ‘save’ game state data from AWS, and load it at the beginning of the next in a cheap, secure way. Additionally, this API abstracts away the complexities of Holochain, creating a highly accessible API that any developer can call with just a single line of code. We are aiming to have this demonstrated by Battle 4, which is on October 4th.2- What can we do NEXTWe mapped out how to develop a working Signals instance for Holochain. This will be called HyperNET, an upgraded version of HoloNET.Why:This feature will achieve the positive result we were looking for in the experiment, as well as potential benefits such as infinite players.Creating a docker to port OASIS / HoloNET through to Threefoldgithub.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDKTrying to get docker working!        committed 06:46PM - 27 Sep 24 UTC          dellams        +91709-135github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK- Fixing OASIS API Docker Image.        committed 02:24PM - 24 Sep 24 UTC          dellams        +10-5- Removed JsonUrl from IMintNFTTransactionRequest interface for now from OASIS.A…PI.Core.Why:Holochain is just an architecture, it is not a storage host in its own right. Threefold offers a decentralised, distributed node network which we can host our software on - which, when functional, will offer an incredibly powerful alternative to AWS. Because OASIS is an abstraction layer across the entire open web, attaching it to a node network will give developers an easy way to develop and host powerful, scalable cross-chain dApps.3- How can we ensure that no matter what, this experiment is a win for Arbitrum as a whole?While we are very grateful for Arbitrum and Thrive letting us conduct this experiment, we were mindful that there are certain on-chain metrics which we also wanted to ensure we delivered on, to help grow the ecosystem as a whole. So while David focused on the pivots, I shifted my focus to working with Jorge from Stellar Gate, to build out the game world and make the battle series come off as a success. This part, we feel, certainly “went right”.What went right:Without bigging ourselves up too much here, a huge amount of work went into this section, and we are proud of what we achieved in a short window of time with limited resources.For a detailed look at the work that we did, please read this document:docs.google.comOASIS - Stellar Gate Anomaly Series Thrive Milestone 3 ReportOASIS - Stellar Gate Anomaly Series Thrive Milestone 3 Report This report will form the basis for Milestone 4 Highlights:(Arbitrum-Specific)Stellar Gate Onboarded to Arbitrum As part of this grant, we brought Stellar Gate over from Phantasma to...But to give a snapshot of what we did:Stellar Gate brought across from Phantasma to Arbitrum25,000+ impressions on X58 Unique wallet registrations7 Smart Contracts writtenTAZZ token launched on Arbitrum3 multiplayer battles hosted, with a final this coming Friday (October 4th)AssetsTrailer film created using runway, 50+ new visual assets createdx.comHoloNET (@H0L0NET) on X@H0L0NET📡 Our upcoming #holochain #gaming project with @ThankArbitrum and @stellargate_io is looking for sign-ups!

A lot of this territory is uncharted, there are dead ends and blocks aplenty. While we didn’t reach the goal we were looking for in our experiment this time round, we did get a lot of learnings which will make us better equipped next time around. Crucially for myself, the idea that this is a shared journey, with a shared destination in mind, is one which matters - while alone we will quickly get lost, together we will make it. To that end, many thanks again to the Thrive team who gave us the chance to explore.John-H.C.-Grabill-1891-Photo-of-Villa-of-Brule.-Ranker1300×938 101 KBONWARDS!"

We are looking to fund 15 projects, each of which can receive a one-off payment ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 ARB.The program is an excellent opportunity for those looking to bring their ideas to life quickly and efficiently, with financial support to boost their project’s impact. Our goal with this program is to spearhead the rapid proliferation of Abitrum’s tech, community, and governance throughout the Global South and establish Ambassador strongholds in the region.Goals of Quick grants:Accessible funding for Global South builders building on top of ArbitrumThe rapid expansion of Arbitrum contributors + governance delegates in the Global South The rapid expansion of educational content pertaining to Orbit + StylusExpected use cases:Minimal bootstrapping for projects at the start of their journey (proactive funding).Retroactive funding by request or discretion to support individuals going above and beyond in the ecosystem. Some examples might be:Community management + AmbassadorshipOpen-source code contributorsGovernance managementEducational contentOne-off workshopsPool size: 75,000 ARBApplication Process + MethodologyOasis Quick Grants will be proactive funding for grantees.We will open up a Quick Grants portal on Charmverse and add in relevant RFPs for Global South consumer crypto. During the application period, we will conduct 1-2 education workshops on the Arbitrum ecosystem and help grantees understand how to structure their grant proposal for maximum success.We will give applicants 2 weeks to submit their proposals with a strict deadline for the first milestone set at 4-6 weeks from the initiation of each project. Weekly office hours will also be held within these two weeks for feedback and guidance.Applicants can draft a proposal on Charmverse via a proposal template. The relevant program manager will review their application and provide feedback/approval in 3-5 business days. This streamlined funding approach aims to enable swift project completion.(Importantly, participants will appreciate the ease of application as no KYC verification is required for this category for grants less than 2K USD; for grants greater than 2K USD, applicants will go through the Arbitrum KYC process and then will be disbursed funds once approved. In regards to all approved applicants, THANK ARB committee will be disbursing the funds.)Given that this is only a 2 month grant program, we will be conducting biweekly check ins and requiring biweekly updates from grantees on Charmverse during the grant process. This will be an automated reminder in TG and via email.By Aug 15, we will ensure Applicants submit their 1st milestone, and we will submit a formal report of findings and feedback to the THANK ARB committee for evaluation by Aug 25.TeamThe program will be managed by the 4 founding team members, who each have specialties on multiple frontsStefen Deleveaux - Partnerships and OutreachMarvelgirl.eth - Consumer Crypto Strategy and Grant SupportEstefania Ochoa - Marketing and Ecosystem DevelopmentAmira Gariba - Operations and Process OptimizationWe will, of course, be providing regular updates via the forum.Many thanks to Thank Arb for making this possible!photo_2024-06-13_16-12-301280×720 128 KB"

It acknowledges the current model’s deep layers and historic foundations, while aspiring to streamline the journey from an artistic idea to a final, consumable song. Efforts to improve this process have been made.Our goal as participants of the current music model is to set the foundations for a deep simplification of it. Permitting a closer relationship between the artists (creators) and the fans (music consumers)The intention is not to redesign the whole actual modu-operandi but to identify the value-adding stakeholders of the current model and making the rails to deeply improve all of them creating incentives via lowering costs and standardisation of procedures that were not possible before via the actual available technology. But, without assuming that the old procedures are going to fade away.We are users of the actual model. We are building to use it now not in ten years.Open Music Distribution ProtocolGoals:Enable artists to upload their music directly to streaming services without intermediaries, receiving the generated revenue directly in their wallets.Automate the distribution of song profits among creators.Improve the efficiency of label-artist relationships automating their conectivity and enforcing transparency.Allow artists to sell their digital phonographic distribution rights (we prefer to called it Songshares) to fans, enabling them to receive advances through their fans or any other entity with access to the protocol (a privilege traditionally reserved for record labels).Grant impactArbitrum Grant has directly participated on the act of funding the initial steps from idea to reality of the SONGS Protocol.Right now we have the version 0.1 of the protrocol up & running on testnets and cleaning it all the way round for the public launch.We have the initial version of the SONGS platform active and up & running.

On our marketplace, companies can create requests for problems they have, and developers can aggregate open-source AI models or build machine learning models to develop solutions for those real-world problems. Anyone can then register to provide computation for those solutions, and the solutions’ responses can be NFTs on any blockchain. This allows end-users and companies to easily access and own high-quality AI responses tailored to their needs with more control over the model and its operator without bearing infrastructure costs.Grant impactThis grant enabled us to develop the AI solution outlined in our proposal. One of the most valuable aspects of this grant was the opportunity to collaborate with projects involved in the LTIPP/STIP initiatives. This collaboration allowed us to identify the genuine AI needs of these projects, which can be effectively addressed with FairAI. Through our marketplace, these projects can uphold their values by utilizing open-source AI solutions in a decentralized manner.Furthermore, upon reaching our milestones, we received valuable feedback from the Arbitrum community, which helped us enhance the usability of our marketplace. For instance, we implemented a feature that enables users to set a spending limit in USDC within their wallet. This allows them to request any AI solution without needing to open the wallet and authorize the transaction.Program experienceWe found the program to be quite positive. We appreciate Jojo’s transparency, prompt responses to our questions, and the support provided throughout the program. Jojo’s feedback, especially when delivering the milestones of our proposal, was also very helpful.Additionally, we would like to emphasize the valuable networking opportunities that arose from this grant, enabling us to connect and exchange ideas with key members of the Arbitrum ecosystem. For example, during GovHack at ETH CC (Brussels) 2024, we had a conversation with Disruption Joe that led to the idea for this grant.Contact infoTo visit our marketplace, simply go to getfair.ai or app.getfair.ai.You can also stay updated by following us on Twitter and Discord.

The goal was to continue to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem, bringing in new long-term users via the thriving DeFi vertical so they can subsequently experience all that Arbitrum has to offer.EpochDistribution AmountEpoch 1149,947.32Epoch 2165,947.30Epoch 3165,946.48Epoch 4168,942.82Epoch 5168,941.26Epoch 6174,943.75Epoch 7180,942.73Epoch 8192,942.43Epoch 9192,943.03Epoch 10192,940.78Epoch 11234,451.09Epoch 12259,960.34Total2,248,849.33Main Results:GMX V2 Liquidity remained strong throughout the STIP-Bridge campaign, despite a months-long ranging market, relatively low volume and a slight general downtrend resulting in negative sentiment. In USD terms, TVL started at $310M on June 26 (at the launch of STIP-B), peaked at $412M on July 29, and ended at around $325M on September 16.794×573 67.4 KBGiven the Summer lull, the GMX V2 liquidity has largely remained sticky, achieving our goals of allowing traders to have consistent and reliable liquidity for trading and liquidity providers to earn stable rewards.Multiple new GM markets have launched with the help of Arbitrum incentives, including ORDI, STX, WIF, PEPE, SHIB, wstETH, tBTC, and USDe. These tokens have had a cumulative volume of $177.36M and a total liquidity of $6.13M.GMX Launched two new GLV Vaults. These new vaults allow GM liquidity to shift dynamically to where traders need it the most, giving liquidity providers unprecedented capital efficiency on GMX V2. Shortly after launch, both vaults have achieved over $10 million in liquidity.Additionally, GMX’s Partnered Protocols showed an increase in growth in GMX V2 TVL, peaking at $144.72M by late July and currently sitting at $119.13M TVL.794×573 65.5 KBNew V2 markets for Pepe and WIF brought in $4.90M in liquidity ($1.67M in WIF and $3.23M in PEPE)794×573 22.3 KBChallenges:Due to the overall market conditions during summer and the ARB token’s falling price, liquidity providers’ incentives were valued lower in USD terms than during the previous STIP campaign. With the drop in price and overall trading volumes decreasing, GM V2 LPs were earning fewer rewards. This market dynamic made growing the amount of TVL, and subsequently sustaining it, more challenging.Trading IncentivesBy providing trading fee rebates, GMX aimed to reduce the trading fees on the DEX to a level comparable to that of prominent centralised exchanges. The initial STIP campaign has shown that offering traders rebates could provide a material boost in on-chain usage of GMX perpetuals and, by extension, the Abritrum chain. STIP-Bridge employs the previously successful model on a smaller scale.EpochDistribution AmountEpoch 1149,906.05Epoch 2149,784.78Epoch 3299,692.51Epoch 4174,975.21Epoch 5174,923.29Epoch 6199,782.81Epoch 7199,908.18Epoch 8199,943.93Epoch 9199,934.14Epoch 10349,895.07Epoch 11349,842.29Epoch 12349,958.21Total2,798,546.47Main Results:Over the course of the STIP-B period, there were 10,456 qualified traders who were awarded an average of 101.67 ARB rebate.Rebates continued to drive trader volumes, with some deviations due to the overall market dynamics and the lower total percentage of rebates offered. There’s a notable increase in trade volume directly following the launch of STIP-B in the last week of June. However, trading volume diminishes after the sizeable market-wide liquidation event at the start of August.794×573 30.4 KBTraders traded a total of $13.03B over the entire STIP-Bridge period, marking a $233M increase compared to the previous 3 months, equivalent to 1.82% growth.New GM pools propelled by the STIP-Bridge grant gathered significant user attention. Traders had seven new GM markets on which they could open positions.In the past 90 days, GMX has emerged as the top fee-generating protocol among all perpetual DEXes, amassing $17 million in fees.Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 9.52.50 PM957×1234 51.7 KBChallenges:The STIP-Bridge grant initially stated users would be rebated up to 75% of their open/close trading fees. Unfortunately, the combination of lower overall allocation from the STIP-Bridge and a steeply lower price of the ARB token meant we could only rebate 51.82% for the totality of the STIP-Bridge Grant.GMX V2’s total open interest and volumes initially grew steadily, but midway through the STIP-Bridge program, they began to fall. Overall market conditions contributed to this decline, and the inability to fully rebate traders’ open and close fees may also have.By early August, Open Interest had halved, while liquidations surged to their highest levels of the year across the board. This period also saw heightened competition in the Perpetual DEX space, making it increasingly difficult to attract and retain users, further adding to the challenges faced by GMX during this phase.Grants IncentivesA portion of the STIP-Bridge grant was allocated to support projects building on the GMX V2 platform, driving innovation and development within the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. Out of the total STIP-B allocation of 5.4 million ARB tokens, GMX designated up to 600K ARB as grant incentives. These grants were awarded to developers and protocols building on GMX V2, contributing to Arbitrum’s continued expansion.ImplementationWe had previously implemented a committee-based model for our initial grants program, which fell under STIP, and saw great responses from the grantees and the DAO. The GMX Grants Committee was also elected to the LTIPP council by the Arbitrum DAO, so it was decided to implement the same committee model for our new grants program.This proved a practical choice, allowing for a streamlined and efficient process of evaluating and awarding grants. The approach ensured that projects aligned with GMX’s vision and Arbitrum’s ecosystem growth were given priority. The grants committee, comprising experienced members from varied backgrounds, carefully reviewed each application to maximise the impact of the allocated funds.The committee comprised five members: Saurabh, Tano, KR, Jonezee, and Shogun. Saurabh also performed the role of the grant administrator. Jrogon and Fredegar, ecosystem and business development contributors, assisted the grants committee with contacting potential recipients and finding high-quality grant applications.After establishing the process, we worked on creating the grants template and setting up a GMX Grants Program landing page to enable grantees to navigate the grants process easily.We allocated a maximum of 600K ARB of incentives to the grantees for the wave two grants, with a cap of 75K ARB per grant. Importantly, those who had previously received an STIP-bridge allocation, LTIPP grant, or grant in wave 1 of the GMX Grants Program were not eligible for the GMX wave 2 grants.We implemented rigorous monitoring mechanisms to track the grant recipients’ progress and ensure the funds were used effectively. We also established precise reporting requirements for the grant recipients, requiring them to submit regular updates on their progress and use of funds. Through these mechanisms, we ensured that the grant funds were used in a manner that maximised their impact on the growth of the GMX V2 ecosystem.The KYC for the grants program was managed end-to-end by BLG, who performed the process for the applicants. GMX paid them 4,000 ARB as a service fee.Outcomes and ImpactWe launched our grants program on June 3 and received 29 applications within a month. Given the number of proposals, the STIP-Bridge timeline, and the limited grant budget, the committee decided it was best to close the program on June 24. Nine of the 29 applications were approved. GMX’s business development contributors stepped in to assist the builders who did not receive grant committee support, ensuring the applicants could nonetheless continue building on GMX and Arbitrum.Our main challenge in the current grants program was attracting high-quality applications, as many participants had already received LTIPP grants or were previous grantees from the first GMX grants program. Additionally, the STIP-Bridge program ran simultaneously, further narrowing the applicant pool. Despite these limitations, we successfully funded several high-quality projects that could meaningfully contribute to the GMX and Arbitrum ecosystems.After a thorough review process, we awarded grants to nine promising projects and funded two small campaigns, allocating roughly 505,000 ARB, with a total disbursement close to 280,000 ARB. These projects showed the strongest potential for driving growth and innovation within the ecosystem. The ‘Highlights’ section, below, illustrates that many successfully did so. In addition, the grant program has helped cultivate accountability and a sense of community involvement and ownership among the grantees. All the accepted grantees were required to submit bi-weekly reports on the GMX governance forum, promoting this process.Project NameAmount Asked (Funds allocated)Amount disbursed for completing the milestonesKnightSafe75K ARB75K ARBCompass Labs40K ARB40K ARBGloop50K ARB20K ARBGoldLink75K ARB25K ARBGMX Arbitrage Bot50K ARB30K ARBSpectra50K ARB0UniDex50K ARB25K ARBEnzyme50K ARB20K ARBOpen Ocean50K ARB30K ARBRadiant Galaxy campaign3K ARB3K ARBCompass Labs X Encode Hackathon8K ARB8K ARBKYC4K ARB4K ARBTotal505,000 ARB280,000 ARBGrants Project HighlightsKnightSafeKnightSafe is a non-custodial smart contract management platform. As an open-source and decentralised digital asset self-custody service, KnightSafe is specifically designed to address the need for seamless interaction with DeFi protocols under customisable role-based access controls, as well as custody issues faced in traditional digital asset management. KnightSafe received a total grant of 75,000 ARB from GMX to drive growth in liquidity and trading volume, and to recover part of its audit costs for enhancing the security level of the KnightSafe protocol. The goal was to boost the trading volume by $50m and increase the capital inflow into GM pools by $3m. Surpassing our original targets, KnightSafe users contributed $184 million+ in trading volume and $32 million+ in capital inflow.1600×457 88.2 KBGoldlinkGoldLink Protocol is an on-chain leveraged prime broker, providing lenders with transparent returns while allowing borrowers to execute complex leveraged investments on third-party exchanges such as GMX. Goldlink obtained a 75K ARB grant, the primary objective of which was to incentivise new lenders and drive retention within their GMX Funding Rate Farming Lending pool. They achieved milestone one by generating more than $1 million in the lending pool and a total of $500K in borrow volume deployed in their GMX Strategy.Compass LabsDojo - a Python-based DeFi platform developed by Compass Labs - is the world’s first platform that allows users to access DeFi with simple Python commands, handling complex blockchain interactions in the background. The GMX integration in Dojo enables users to source data, backtest, simulate and optimise trading strategies and smart contracts on local testnets, and monitor real-time performance and protocol analytics. Initially, their application was narrowly rejected due to some ambiguity around the stated aims. However after GMX’s BD contributors worked with the Compass team, they were able to refine the milestones and get their application accepted.Compass was able to achieve all its milestones and secured a grant of 40,000 ARB. The GMX integration into Dojo will also take centerstage during the upcoming Encode London Hackathon, jointly organised by Compass Labs and the Cambridge and Oxford Blockchain Societies. The Grants Committee approved an additional budget of 8,000 ARB to facilitate hundreds of involved hackers engaging in developing AI trading agents for use on GMX on Arbitrum.Arbitrage BotThe GMX Arbitrage Bot is an open-source searcher bot that can detect and profitably execute upon differences in funding rates across CEX/DEX perps platforms in a delta-neutral manner. The Arbitrage Bot was awarded a grant of 50,000 ARB, as funding rate arbitrage solutions were considered a high-priority item for GMX. The developer was successfully able to complete two milestones of the grant proposal and make the bot live and publically available. Moreover, he also organised a successful workshop session on how to install and use the bot for the GMX community.UniDexUniDex is the everything aggregator in DeFi, allowing users to find efficient routes for their swaps, perp trades, and even other aggregators. Their bottom line is to save as much money and time for users when trading across any network. UniDex was awarded a grant of 50K ARB and they were successfully able to complete the first milestone. Unfortunately, some of their trading data wasn’t recorded because of a configuration error with their GMX referral code. But the protocol was nonetheless able to generate a Trading Volume of 11 million USD.1600×209 51 KBSpectraSpectra is an EVM-centric protocol for interest rate derivatives with an easy-to-use flagship app. The Spectra protocol is permissionless, meaning its services are entirely open for public use. Anyone can create new markets at will, swap yield derivatives, or become a liquidity provider. Spectra was able to secure a grant of 50,000 ARB, and garnered TVL of 500K USD, but didn’t manage to achieve its milestones.GloopGloop Finance is an upcoming GMX-centric yield optimization and leveraged looping protocol. The primary objective of their grant was to bolster the amount of liquidity available for loopers contributing to the GMX V2 pools. By offering higher yields the protocol makes lending more attractive and, in turn, stimulates loopers to utilise the protocol, boosting liquidity on GMX. Gloop were awarded a grant of 50K ARB, and they successfully completed milestone one.EnzymeEnzyme (formerly known as Melon) is a leading on-chain asset management protocol, accelerating growth for builders and asset managers. It enables vault managers to build strategies and vaults on-chain, incorporating perpetual exchanges like GMX, and easily showcase their NAV/track record in real-time and historically. Enzyme received a grant of 50,000 ARB, and they were successfully able to achieve milestone 1 and get the vaults live and audited. The integration of GMX forms a foundational puzzle piece in Enzyme’s strategy to expand its asset management services on the Arbitrum blockchain.OpenOceanOpenOcean is a leading DEX Aggregator and cross-chain swap aggregator, offering a suite of tools across 30+ networks and 1000+ decentralised liquidity sources to provide traders with the best returns. OpenOcean was awarded a grant of 50K ARB to integrate GMX’s swap functionality into its DEX aggregator, providing its 1.3 M+ users access to GMX’s 400M liquidity on Arbitrum. The team successfully achieved two milestones, getting GMX’s swap trading functionality integrated into three affiliated protocols in the process.Reflections on the Grants ProgramIn this second wave of GMX grants, the focus was on onboarding projects that could expand the GMX ecosystem’s utility and increase protocol adoption. Despite constraints, such as not being able to fund LTIPP, STIP-Bridge, and Grants Program wave 1 grantees, the program attracted a good number of high-quality applications. This speaks to the growing recognition of GMX within the broader DeFi ecosystem.One of the key success factors of this cohort was the improved, milestone-based evaluation process, with stricter criteria focused on measurable ecosystem impact. With the successful conclusion of this second wave, the GMX grants program is well-positioned for future continuation.Achievements of GMX’s STIP-Bridge ProgramGMX saw a stabilisation in liquidity, with a moderate increase in pre-incentive GMX V2 TVL. This increase in TVL reflected the success of the program in attracting and retaining users within the GMX ecosystem.Following the launch of incentives, there was a measured uptick in daily trading activity and user count.For this STIP-Bridge wave of the GMX Grants Program, there was a smaller applicant pool of projects to work with. This was because those who had previously won a grant with the Arbitrum DAO or GMX Grants Program were excluded from participation. In total, 9 of 29 applications were approved by the GMX Grants Committee.Testimonials from grant recipients and partners within the ecosystem, highlighting the influence of grants on their projects or the ecosystem at large, offer firsthand insight into the grants’ impact.Throughout the course of the STIP-Bridge campaign, GMX has implemented even more measures to bring actions on-chain on Arbitrum. GMX DAO participants can now create proposals directly on-chain via Tally to be approved by the tokenholders, for example.We saw an increase in token markets on GMX, with a total of seven new markets for traders getting listed on GMX V2.Lastly, GMX further enhanced its UX through continuous feature enhancements, such as introducing a complete suite of DeFi trading alerts and notifications, and two auto-optimising GLV vaults that boosted liquidity and capital efficiency.Conclusion:The STIP-Bridge program had clear goals: to strengthen GMX’s foundational liquidity layer for DeFi on the Arbitrum blockchain, attract new on-chain users, bring new assets to the GMX V2 platform, increase trading volumes, and support others in building on the V2 platform through a Grants Program.In light of these goals, the STIP-Bridge campaign can be deemed a success overall. GMX was able to keep deep liquidity readily available, while offering low-cost trading and an enhanced onchain user experience. Traders, including new users, came to Arbitrum through the GMX V2 platform, generating volumes and gas usage for the network. This dynamic was particularly evident in the first months of the program. However, the effects lessened during the lower-volume summer period. Additionally, the GMX Grants Program expanded the ambitions and reach of nine projects building on GMX, meaningfully contributing to the long-term growth of the Arbitrum network.We extend our gratitude to the Arbitrum DAO and the STIP-Bridge Grants Program for their support. And we look forward to continuing our journey to develop a robust, efficient, and user-friendly decentralised exchange, which serves as a powerful liquidity base layer for all of Arbitrum DeFi."

We realized that crypto users across the globe pay for utility service valued at over 20 billion USD monthly, which is significant compared to the current stablecoin transaction volume for real payment of around 149 billion USD in April 2024 (Source: Real Users Account for Less Than 10% of Stablecoin Transaction Volume: Report). Bringing this transaction on the chain could have a significant benefit considering the volume of transactions that can be generated.Beyond payment for utility services, the app allows users to list their services, pay for digital services and also get paid for offering digital services like smart contract development and graphics design, among many other services categorized under digital services on the platform.Grant impactThe Arbitrum grant we received from Questbook Arbitrum Grant Program, season 2, domain “New Protocols and Ideas,""  was pivotal to the progress we’ve made today, and that covers:Development of our web app that is available at https://app.utoken.network/Development of the service listing functionality, which allows users to add any digital or public service they offerDevelopment of utility payment features for users to pay for utility services like data subscription, gift cards, etc.Development of digital payment features for users to pay for digital services.Support for 14 European countries, the USA, and Nigeria for utility service paymentsIntegration with Telegram through our mini app here: Telegram: Contact @utokenAppBeyond the funding provided, the feedback we got from @JoJo and other community members who participated in our beta program has really been helpful in bringing us closer to our goal.Program experienceThe overall experience can be described as incredible thanks to an effective communication approach. The application guidelines on Questbook were straightforward and easy to follow. Aside from that, the integration of the other processes, including KYC verification, payment request, and release, also helped with the overall experience.Our special appreciation goes again to @JoJo, who has proven not just to be a good program manager but an excellent communicator.Contact infoFor further enquiries or follow up on our progress, we are active on LinkedIn (Utoken | LinkedIn) and Twitter (x.com).Thanks to everyone working with us to shape the future of stablecoins for payment."

It was coined ‘Arbitrum’s Biggest Mini-Grant Series Ever’ with 32 winners, each winning 2500 ARB (equivalent of roughly $5k USD at the time).Each week, contest applicants and winners were highlighted on social media, and winners were excited about their winnings and added to a TG group with the other winners. We were told by the program manager that this is where we would stay in touch for our payouts.Timeline and Sequence of EventsHere is what I could find on X about the contest on JokeRace (week 4): arbitrumdao minigrants round 4February 7thLooking back through dates in the Telegram group, as a week 3 winner I was added to the TG group as a winner on February 7th. On this same date, we were told that Diana, the program manager, had initiated the request for payouts to Arbitrum for all four of us week 3 winners.February 14thDiana shares in the TG group that she has requested payouts from Arbitrum Foundation for week 1-4 winners.February 27thDiana messages that 7 projects have been KYC approved and will receive their payouts.** to note: KYC statuses of people are being shared openly within a TG group of over 30 people. If they are failing and have not passed, this is also publicly shared.March 2ndWinners inquire about their payout status, and Diana mentions that payouts from a week of winners can’t be paid out until all 4 winners KYC checks have been approved from the week. It is not clear the logic from Arbitrum why this would be.Diana mentions not to DM her as she has hundreds of DMs waiting for her to respond and asks us to message the whole group with our questions, and that she will respond after ETHDenver. I saw that one winner from my same week was paid out, but I wasnt, so I inquired about that because it wasnt clear based on the message she had shared, and then Diana responds she is not sure why either.Winners noticed that payouts were sent in this first batch to some winners within the grant council and/or Arbitrum partners.March 12thA winner shares he is concerned about the upcoming ARB 70% token unlock, and delays in payout timing affecting the value of what he receives with likely impending ARB value drop.March 19thConfusion and concern begin, with winners seeing daily messages about the status updates of all rounds, KYC checks, payout timings, needing the funds for development, and suggestions to post on the Arbitrum Forum for answers. Concerns arise about this being a scam contest, and people share they have been now waiting for over two months for payouts. Projects now begin sharing they wont be able to execute due to the large drop in ARB value.March 20thMultiple winners including myself share we received 625 ARB, but not the full 2500 ARB. This is a one-time payout with no milestones, so there is no reason why winners should receive partial payouts, especially as other winners received 2500. Two people received 1875.March 28thA winner asks for a status update from Diana on why they (and others) received 625 instead of 2500. Diana said she asked Arbitrum but it is not clear why.April 1stWinners start trying to track down who the parties are involved in this grant, trying to message Plurality Labs on X but DMs are off. One winner posts (along with others questions about Arbitrum’s integrity and credibility):“With each passing day, I believe less and less in the Arbitrum project. Bureaucrats.” $ARBGhostAnother message from a winner:“It’s common knowledge that Arbitrum’s dispersal times are slow, but this is on another level.”April 9thDiana shares that by EOW, KYC checks for all winners should be done so then payouts can continue/complete.April 16thMore winners receive payouts, but some share they received none or partial. One winner received 168 ARB.April 24thOne winner inquires about her KYC check issue.May 14thDiana shares Arbitrum has approved KYC checks for 8 more projects, but there are still 11 projects still waiting for approval. I was one of these, which is confusing as I also received a 625 ARB payout, but I guess even without KYC approval.May 17th8 projects receive their payouts.May 31stAfter 4 months of chaos, confusion, lack of communication, and disjointed/haphazard distribution of funds, I decided that I would try to take action by bringing together all the parties I was aware of involved in this grant process, from Arbitrum, to Plurality Labs/Thrive Protocol, to Fractal. I emailed and contacted the Arbitrum team, and wasn’t familiar with Plurality/Thrive Protocol, but found contacts there as well as the Fractal team I had messaged on Telegram. I initiated a TG group with these parties, and a few of the winners that were open to sharing their voices and experiences (multiple shared they were nervous about sharing their voices if it would cause problems with them receiving grants from the parties involved in the future).June 5thThrive Protocol hosts JokeRace intervention calls with winners so we can voice our issues and finally be heard. We and others receive our payments, after a total or a four month delay.June 19thThe remaining 11 winners are confirmed now paid (four months post-contest).In summary, these are the major points of concern:Due to major delays on payout timings and resulting ARB value drop, multiple projects were not able to be executed and many half-executed, yet our X handles were leveraged as a part of ArbitrumDAO’s ‘Biggest Minigrants Round Ever’:x.comThank ARB (@ThankArbitrum) on X@ThankArbitrum@arbitrum We're 1 day into Round 4 of ""Our Biggest Minigrants Yet"" and have 4 solid applications so far in the ""Scaling DeFi for the Masses"" category@LocaleDao @arbitrumafrica @BitsaveProtocol @ReFiParamariboOur KYC statuses were shared publicly in a TG group with 35 people. It was fully known by all whether we successfully completed or not.There was no communication from the ArbitrumDAO or Thrive Protocol team in this TG group until the very end, and Diana was the only point of contact and clearly overwhelmed with the myriad of issues.Along the way, I collected feedback from winners that included these responses:“Have had a horrible experience”“My team morale is way down and no one believes me we are going to receive the funds”“I feel like this could easily have been resolved months ago, they could have reissued links to redo KYC, and maybe given an explanation how to do it”“Also, the projects that were by voting council members, have been paid out in full”“Anyone else feel like half of us are just never going to see the grant money?” Many of us are understanding that there are learnings in the grant processes. Yet, this has been an experience where grantees found themselves powerless.In general, grant receivers are grateful for the opportunity to receive grants. However, when the struggle to actually receive funds clouds the experience with chaos, stress over many months waiting, confusion amongst teams and community members - questions arise whether the process was worth it.The ask here is for financial restitution for the winners that did not receive their payouts on a timely basis, which resulted in more negative than positive for these winners - beyond just the large drop in ARB value.I am requesting response to this post, specifically about the financial restitution request, from the ArbitrumDAO."

The Opportunity
The global gaming in","This forum post aims to function as an educational hub for the Arbitrum DAO, focused on highlighting the potential impacts of web3 gaming on the Arbitrum ecosystem and its stakeholders.Contents here are expected to evolve and update as new information and data is available.Core Contributors: Dan Peng (@Djinn), Karel Vuong (@karelvuong), Xai Games, the Helika Team, other gaming ecosystem builders.Join the Gaming Working Group: https://t.me/+spktzHCOL4MwZGU5The OpportunityThe global gaming industry is massive. With over 3 billion global gamers (1 in every 2.36 people) and ~$184b in revenue (2023) being driven across the global games market, there is a massive opportunity ahead for the web3 gaming space.While web3 gaming is still in its infancy, Arbitrum has a unique opportunity to immediately acquire promising builders through a combination of grant allocation and a support network led by experts.There are several key points leading us to this hypothesis:Gaming is an easy win for Arbitrum; all the ingredients for success are present. There just needs to be a catalyst to ignite a snowball effect and draw the attention of talented game builders.Arbitrum currently ranks #7 in total games among network competitors, despite minimal incentives → highlighting that builders have chosen to build on Arbitrum primarily for its merits across technology, liquidity, and access to usersLaunch of Arbitrum Orbit and Stylus are additional pieces of critical infrastructure that should attract game builders which, in turn, will increase the number of quality gamesThe gaming audience is immense, and capturing a fraction of that traffic for web3 within the Arbitrum ecosystem could yield exponential ROIIndustry is currently sized at $272 billion in 2024, and is projected to hit $426 billion by 2029User base exceeds 3 billion as of 2022Gamers coming on-chain to Arbitrum will bring a net benefit for all protocols:The majority of gamers are in the 18-34 year old range, prime for DeFi and typically early adopters of technologyNow is the time to act - gaming infrastructure is maturing, and growth is poised for networks that are ready to support web3 gaming:“2024 is a growth year in terms of bringing people on to Web3,” Yat Siu (Animoca Games)Dmitrii Morozov, CEO of GG MetaGame, notes: “The groundwork laid in 2022 and 2023 with alpha and beta stages is coming to fruition, with many titles set for commercial release in 2024, potentially bringing Web3 gaming to new heights.”BackgroundThe STIP process kicked off various discovery efforts to better support gaming and position the Arbitrum ecosystem for success. As part of these efforts, various builders and gaming experts shared content to help frame the opportunity and also educate the DAO on the standards, ecosystem, and processes that support game development.One of the first DAO discussions on gaming was presented at an open delegate call focused on gaming, with @karelvuong from Treasure sharing his experiences around building Arbitrum’s gaming ecosystem from the ground up. @Soby from XAI also provided some perspective on why Arbitrum was their destination of choice despite having great working relationships with other chains.In the above discussions and numerous other DAO related conversations on how we can grow gaming, it is abundantly clear that gaming could provide numerous benefits to the Arbitrum ecosystem as detailed further in the Appendix.Data across the competitive landscape pointed to several insights:Leaders and major L2/L1 competitors are aggressively pursuing games and other ecosystem builders with budgets of $100-500 million in grants and other incentives - this was recently showcased with multiple networks pursuing Treasure DAO in their L3 searchArbitrum is the L2 leader in DeFi but ranks below major network competitors across gaming presence metrics and gaming migration.Development expenses for Web3 games are anticipated to match or surpass those of comparable Web2 games. This is attributed to the overarching requirement for parity in game quality, compounded by an absence of a defined playbook for marketing and user acquisition, along with a negative stigma among traditional gamers.The game publisher model, in which publishers provide funding and dedicated hands-on support to game builders, has the potential to catalyze and accelerate growth of web3 gaming on Arbitrum.Arbitrum DAO’s early focus and current makeup that skews towards decentralized finance was great, but has meant DAO programs often did not account for specific needs of gaming projects.These insights are further illustrated in the Appendix section below. They point to a need to aggressively grow the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem through support for current and new gaming projects and studios – with the guidance and dedicated resources of experts already working to grow Arbitrum’s dominance in gaming (publishers, game developers, etc.).Throughout the following months, builders continued to share about their experiences and present gaming topics to the DAO for the purpose of education:Gaming Open Office Hours: KPIs 101 Recording[2024-02-02 11:00 GMT-6]A deep dive from Lucas Fulks (Helika CPO) from his experience at Zynga and Sciplay on how successful games work and how to build a sustainable gaming ecosystem.Gaming Open Office Hours: Introducing the Gaming Catalyst Proposal[2024-01-19 10:03 GMT-6]An introductory call to the Gaming Catalyst Proposal and the dynamics that foster a healthy, builder-focused gaming ecosystem.Macro Landscape & Arbitrum’s PeersDespite Arbitrum’s leadership as the de facto home for decentralized trading with its recent accolades and position leading bridged $ETH and DEX volume, it is still lagging when it comes to gaming.Arbitrum’s Gaming Presence Across Web3 NetworksGame7 Research published a report covering the State of Web3 Gaming in 2023 on October 15, 2023, and the results are telling. Arbitrum falls in the middle of the pack across several indicators with a gap that will continue to widen unless bold and decisive action is taken.At the time of the report, Arbitrum was the 7th largest ecosystem by number of games, trailing the likes of Polygon, Solana, Immutable and Avalanche. While the quantity of games in itself is not a meaningful indicator of success, it signals that Arbitrum is experiencing challenges with game acquisition. In addition to attracting new games, it’s imperative to track player adoption and employ quality controls as other metrics of success.Many of Arbitrum’s peer ecosystems have dedicated gaming arms and incentives used to attract game studios to build on their network, often managed by the associated network’s foundation entity with meaningful agency and capital to deploy towards gaming projects. Fortunately, the Arbitrum DAO is armed with the necessary funds, and is capable of deploying them in a manner that meaningfully impacts the network’s growth. 1600×901 169 KBGaming Within Ethereum Layer 2 LandscapeWithin the Ethereum L2 landscape itself, Immutable has the pole position with 75% more games building on the network when compared to Arbitrum. While there is a relatively steep drop to third place that tapers off, there has been a concerted effort from other ecosystems to gain ground. The Optimism ecosystem in particular recently hired Ryan Wyatt and Urvit Goel to lead growth and gaming BD. These are the same leaders who are credited with much of Polygon’s early gaming lead as well as the landmark Polygon and Immutable gaming partnership. In short, Arbitrum currently holds second place, but this could change rapidly given the concerted efforts of other chains in growing their gaming presence.1600×898 122 KB1600×898 111 KB1226×696 184 KBGames Building on Blockchain FrameworksWhen it comes to blockchain frameworks (eg. Arbitrum Orbit, OP Stack, Polygon CDK, Avalanche Subnets, etc.), Arbitrum lags in live L3s building atop the stack but comes in fourth in terms of active games. OP Stack currently leads the pack with 25 live networks.This is not to say Arbitrum is underperforming necessarily. Given the respective launch dates of competitive networks, Arbitrum has shown that even without significant gaming focused marketing or grants, developers are still building new games and migrating from other networks into Arbitrum. This speaks to Arbitrums potential for gaming, especially given its brand recognition, stability, and technology products.Imagine how the data would look with a significant grant program and experienced publishers working collaboratively with the DAO to source, secure, and market talented teams building upon the Arbitrum network.1600×898 173 KBArbitrum has become the de facto king of decentralized finance, but falls far behind in the gaming space - which is both a risk to future network growth and an opportunity to aggressively grow the sector.About Building Web3 GamesDeveloping games has incredibly high upside when it comes to potential network effects, but it does come with the risk of being a resource and time intensive endeavor.This also compounds with the addition of web3 elements. Not only do teams have to create a game that is fun and rewarding, but they must find ways to generate value and integrate complex web3 components that introduce additional risk and resourcing puzzles.Benefits of Web3The benefits of web3 in gaming listed below has been pulled and paraphrased from an essay authored by Colleen Sullivan, Co-Head of Ventures at Brevan Howard Digital:Ownership: Physical and digital experiences have started to blend and we have seen proof points emerge in web2 games that have a perfect use case in web3 as non-fungible assets. If a gamer pays $15 for a skin in Fortnite or Counter-Strike and had the option to own it completely or not, it’s likely they would choose the web3 version of the skin. The same applies in a non-spending context with games like EVE Online, Diablo, or World of Warcraft where items are earned – usually after hours of hard work and grinding. Ownership extends beyond assets though to encompass games themselves in areas of governance as well as creation. Some games also become platforms (ie. Fortnite, Roblox) which allow users to create and contribute user-generated content (UGC). Web3 can allow gamers to have greater ownership in games, contribute to building and extending the game through mods, new game modes, and more.Composable and Interoperable: In web3, assets (ERC-20s, ERC-721s, and ERC-1155s) as well as smart contracts form building blocks which exist anywhere the internet exists. The dream of “bringing your sword from one game to another game” is a concept that can be brought to life through the power of web3. For games that are build fully on-chain with their game logic built into smart contracts, it allows for the creation of a forever game that exists anywhere the internet exists and doesn’t require centralized servers. For savvy game builders and the right foundation, this allows for new games or expressions to be built atop games. Wallet holdings – which are public – allow for generalized segmentation, allowing builders to port assets and status permissionlessly across games (and beyond as well!).Onramping Non-Spenders into Game Economies: In traditional games, especially in free-to-play (F2P) games, the lion’s share of players are non-spenders. They might enjoy the game and spend hours in it but they did not spend any money. Per the Newzoo Global Games Market Report 2022, there were ~299 million gamers on console and ~458 million on PC who played but did not spend money. The data is murky on the percentage of gamers who make in-game purchases, but the number 5% is often cited. In web3, if game assets are tokenized and non-spenders are unknowingly introduced to blockchain game economies, wouldn’t it be something if they suddenly became aware that the sword they spent hours grinding to obtain was worth $4,000? Or the token airdrop they received had meaningful value behind it. Non-spender successfully converted.User-Generated Content (UGC): Blockchains give creators the ability to establish provenance and have digital property rights over the virtual goods they create. These virtual goods could be potentially sold to an eager buyer instantly, effectively enabling UGC on steroids. There has been a growing trend of games moving to Games-as-a-Service or live service models, with many embracing UGC. In these models, contributions of people from all over the world foster network effects and keep content fresh in games.Cost and Considerations of Game DevelopmentDevelopment CostsTo understand costs surrounding game development, the easiest baseline would be to look at simple digital games from a pure development cost.Mobile games are often the cheapest, quickest to market games, but also compete in a crowded market. In 2024, the average mobile game costs between $100k-250k, while larger premiere games exceed the $1m mark. Larger, complex triple A titles like Call of Duty often incur costs well above $100m just for development alone.The cost examples above are without any web3 integrations or components, which can quickly increase costs depending on complexity. For any game with on-chain trading elements, it may be prudent to scope the integration and production of the on-chain building separately. Our estimate is at least a 25-50% increase in costs for web3 development and integration on top of traditional gaming costs.When looking at the high end of web3 gaming, we can draw some conclusions based on recent launches. Triple A web3 title Shrapnel, launched on the Avalanche network, pulled in two funding rounds and a token sale totaling $37.5m between Series A and Seed funding, and has been in development since at least 2021. However, the game is still in development as of early 2024 and has not released milestones for open beta testing.While the high capital requirements to build games does not mean that networks should incur 100% of the burden of funding the game development life cycle, in a landscape with aggressive incentives offered by competitive networks and a growing number of talented teams looking for the right ecosystem partner, incentives can make a significant difference for gaming studios.Development TimeDue to the fast-paced nature of crypto, game developers are encouraged to create value and go-to-market in a shortened timeline compared to the traditional gaming industry. While traditional games in web2 often see development cycles reach 3-5 year mark for larger titles or 1-3 mark for smaller, indie games, the timeline for web3 games is compressed with the emergence of pre-vertical slice game prototypes required to maintain attention and support community engagement post-launch of web3 gaming projects. This means that larger budgets are necessary to maintain quality on accelerated time scales.Aggressive building means a need for more resources dedicated to development, game design, tokenomics, and user acquisition while also upskilling to incorporate new development paradigms (eg. Solidity and smart contracts) in traditional game development.Summary of Developer Needs from Chains/EcosystemsDevelopmentDistribution & MarketingLiquidity (Players and Capital)FundingIncentives and grants are primarily used to support opex, rarely for player redistributionGiven the capital requirements for games and the primary driver for user retention/acquisition being fun - it makes sense to utilize funds for the creation of web3 games as well as onboarding incentives that are more common in DeFi.Successful games will look different from successful DeFi protocolsWithin gaming, there is less focus on yield, being +EV, or value-accrual from trading, and more of a focus on creating an experience that delivers fun and engaging experiences to players. Brand building, fostering a vibrant player community, and forging an emotional connection back to one’s IP is often a priority for titles which adds to the complexity and cost of game building. Beyond the game development process, this necessitates concerted, bespoke efforts towards marketing and creativity that need to be tailored for each individual game.Current Gaming Landscape on ArbitrumDespite the lack of targeted incentives for games, the Arbitrum landscape has grown organically and is flourishing across the available ecosystems.With additional incentives and strong programs like the Gaming Catalyst Program, the current builders and experts can help fuel exponential growth.A non-exhaustive list of live gaming-related projects on Arbitrum includes:Game Ecosystems and/or Publishers:Treasure (first Arbitrum title launched Oct 2021; 10+ live games)Xai (no live games on Arbitrum; several titles in active development or migration)Reboot (first Arbitrum title launched Jan 2023)Hytopia (no live games on Arbitrum; first title in active development or migration)Sanko GameCorp (4+ live games and streaming platform live on Arbitrum, multiples games in active development or migration for Orbit Chain gaming ecosystem)Live Games and Game Studios:Pirate Nation by Proof of PlayBattlePlan! by Pixel Vault (part of Reboot)Runiverse by Forgotten RunesThe Beacon by SkillCap Studios (part of Treasure)Zeeverse by Beetroot Lab (part of Treasure)SMOL (part of Treasure)Mighty Action Heroes by Mighty Bear Games (part of Treasure)Kuroro Beasts by Trudan Studios (part of Treasure)Kaiju Cards by Permadeath Studios (part of Treasure)Knights of the Ether by Merlyn Labs (part of Treasure)Seekers of Tokane and Aurory Tactics by AuroryBitmates (part of Treasure)Realm (part of Treasure)Tales of Elleria (part of Treasure)BattleFly (part of Treasure)Skyborne Legacy by Revolving GamesFarcana by Farcana StudioRuffion Reborn by Forgotten MachineCaptain & Company by KAP GamesSakura Pinball by Sanko GameCorpMilady Tekken by Sanko GameCorp¡Sanko! by Sanko GameCorpInfrastructure:Core, Account Abstraction, Payments:ThirdwebAlchemyBlockusSequenceHallidayData & Analytics:HelikaThe Role of Game PublishersGame publishers and gaming ecosystems play a crucial role in the gaming industry by providing teams with a range of benefits that often help to accelerate and further the chances of success for game developers, including but not limited to:Financial Support: Game development is a resource-intensive process, and publishers can provide the necessary funding for developers. This financial support often covers development costs, marketing expenses, and other operational needs, typically in exchange for future economic incentives and alignment through revenue sharingExpertise and Guidance: Publishers typically have experienced teams with expertise in various aspects of game development, including design, marketing, distribution, and monetization. They can offer valuable guidance to developers, helping them navigate challenges and make informed decisions throughout the development process. On the monetization front, publishers can bring valuable insights into effective strategies, including pricing models, in-app purchases, mint strategies, and other revenue streams both in web2 and web3 contexts.Marketing and Promotion: Publishers excel in marketing and promoting games to a wide audience. They leverage their established networks, relationships, and marketing channels to create awareness for a game through events, media relations, and driving user acquisition through paid marketing.Distribution Channels: Publishers have established distribution channels, both digital and physical, allowing games to reach a broader audience. This can include partnerships with major distribution platforms (such as Epic Games, Steam, or the mobile app stores), brick-and-mortar retailers, and other distribution networks that help games reach players globally.Access to Resources: Publishers can provide developers with access to additional resources such as advanced technology, licensing deals, proprietary tools, or quality assurance and playtesting support. This access can accelerate the development process and give studios an edge that otherwise would be difficult or time consuming to build as an independent studio.Network DynamicsOther networks have a huge head start on Arbitrum and have made substantial investments towards gaming through the establishment of dedicated gaming teams and a dedicated allocation of funding.Per the aforementioned research, Arbitrum recently exceeded Ethereum transaction volume on a 24h basis but is currently ranked 7th in terms of games onboarded. Furthermore, the network does not have a formal gaming incentives program like many network peers.Comparables of gaming-focused grants and incentive programs across select peer networks (excludes generalized incentive programs; ordered by size):Immutable: $500m Ecosystem Fund from June 17, 2022 (link)Ronin: 150M RON or ~$280M at time of writing from January 27, 2022 (link)Avalanche: $220m fund from March 8, 2022 (link)Polygon: $190M altogether - $100m fund from July 21, 2021 (link) and $90m+ Polygon Village fund from November 9, 2023 (link)Solana: $150m grant program from November 26, 2022 (link)Optimism: $2M retroactive grant to on-chain games from January 11, 2024 (link); excludes generalized incentives allocated to the Ecosystem Fund (including the Partner Fund managed by the Optimism Foundation) and RetroPGFWith the majority of the Arbitrum ecosystem’s funds resting in the hands of the DAO, it is imperative that the Arbitrum DAO community mobilizes to seize the opportunity that lies ahead of us to become the web3 ecosystem of choice for games.Major opportunity for growth with gaming set to onboard the massesGaming as a segment is highly retentive and sticky, and represents an opportunity to onboard a new user profile that is not only underrepresented on Arbitrum but who may be new to crypto overall. As an untapped addressable market of users, there’s an opportunity to bring them into web3 through the lens of gaming and sell them on the wonders of the space.The landscape is beginning to heat upStill early days in general and is a ripe opportunity that Arbitrum should seize]1024×576 36.4 KBAlthough the average spend per user may be lower, gamers bring mass network activity and attention to ecosystems.Gaming is a core use case for Arbitrum Stylus and OrbitWith the rollout of Orbit, teams now have a way to create their own L3 ecosystem built on top of powerful Arbitrum network technology. This advantage is perfect for games looking for performance, cheaper transactions, and curated networks customized for their use case.Stylus opens the doors to thousands of developers coding in other languages to create their games within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The support for C++ brings on a very popular game development language right into EVM compatibility, lowering barriers to entry for game studios that are often staffed with technical teams focused on one developer stack.Maintaining Arbitrum’s technology lead and proliferating adoption of its productsArbitrum boasts an impressive set of innovative technology and products through its Orbit stack which allows developers and protocols to inherit improvements such as AnyTrust and other forms of altDA, EVM+ compatibility via Stylus, BOLD’s next generation fraud proofs, and Timeboost. This is all on top of significantly lower fees and faster blocktimes which is very conducive for the gaming use case.In particular with Stylus, Stylus contracts are over an order of magnitude faster with significantly lower gas fees due to the superior efficiency of WASM programs. Memory is 100-500x cheaper when using Stylus, unlocking new use cases now that consuming RAM is viable on the blockchain. Compared to using Solidity, WASM programs are much more efficient. There are many reasons for this, including the decades of compiler development for Rust and C. WASM also has a faster runtime than the EVM, resulting in faster execution. Generally, a 10x improvement has been seen for contracts using WASM languages compared to contracts using Solidity. Use cases not practical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus. Computation is over 10x improved. Memory is over 100x improved. Cryptography libraries can now be deployed as custom precompiles, permissionlessly. Stylus applied to gaming will be a significant unlock for what will be possible through fully on-chain games and autonomous worlds. The greatest breeding ground for blockchain innovation has arrived.Overview: The Three Pillars of Building a Successful, Profitable GameThe three pillars are:Positive unit economics: Per-capita revenue and cost optimizationScale: Retention and user acquisitionA healthy dose of fun: EngagementPositive Unit EconomicsReaching positive unit economics means a game needs to make more money from users than they cost to acquire. The two components of positive unit economics:User Acquisition: Consistently optimizing user acquisition is critical to bring down the cost to acquire users. This means knowing what a user or cohort costs, where exactly they came from and how they engage with game through their full journey (ie. deep funnel).Lifetime Value (LTV): Diligently optimizing the game to increase LTV is a key to success. Games will never get it right the first time. Build systems (LiveOps, points programs, A/B testing) that allow optimizations to be implemented quickly. Use your system to measure results using statistically significant user cohorts, then implement the best configuration. Repeat … repeat … repeat … and reach the break-even point where your user lifetime value exceeds the cost to acquire them.1124×856 200 KBThe path to positive unit economicsScaleScale is often thought of as user acquisition. This is incorrect: User acquisition is only one part of the equation, but is often a game’s largest liability.If this equation is not monitored closely and unit economics measured, a game will scale unsustainably, losing money and will not reach profitability.Scale = Retention x User acquisitionWith the proper systems in place, every user that churns is a data point that moves the game closer to profitability. Incremental optimization is how games go from zero to studio hero.1234×926 185 KBRetention is a critical component of scaling sustainablyHealthy Dose of FunFun is a requirement for success but on its own is not sustainable. Fun means user engagement; The actions taken or the frequency of play are example measures of fun. The issue with some Web3 games is they inflate these numbers with financial incentives. This makes their numbers look great short term but is unsustainable.Example: A game reduced the ROI on farmers, did the engagement of regular users decrease? If the answer is yes, that is critical to know. “I should build a feature that offsets the loss in engagement we’ll see when farming gets nerfed.”Striking a healthy balance between fun and sustainability is critical to have both engagement and profitability.1078×846 238 KBHow to Measure Success in Web3 GamingThere are several phases to game development that each have their own measurements of success. As a game progresses through the phases of the game lifecycle it’s critical these measurements for success are achieved at each stage.Phase 1 - Game DevelopmentFunctioning core loopGame systems are configurableHigh quality taxonomy implementedCore understanding of LiveOps and how it will work in the gamePlanning user identities and attributionPlans for monetizationPhase 2 - Alpha/Closed BetaWhat systems did not function as expected, including core loop, liveops and monetization systemsHave all dysfunctional systems been restored?Game stability beyond 99.5%What is the NPS (net promoter score) from initial users? Is it above 50?Phase 3 - Open BetaWhat are the initial metrics on retention, engagement, and monetization?Where did drop-off in the user funnels occur?What exact marketing channel and marketing creative are generating our best users?A/B testing implemented and successfully deployedAre the game optimization mechanisms functioning as expected?Phase 4 - Game LaunchIncremental and measurable improvements with each user acquisition push to both CAC and LTVIs our break-even point less than 1-year away?Which user acquisition channels are working and sustainable and which are notIs the Cost of Acquiring a User coming down over time? Is User Lifetime Value increasing over time?What percentage of users are payers?What response are the users demonstrating to features and liveops?Have we tested our marketing channels to ensure the economics hold true when scale is increased?Phase 5 - GrowthAre we trending to positive unit economics?Have we been reliably exceeding our goals for both the cost to acquire users and lifetime value?Are unit economics holding true as we scale?Which marketing channels are performing bestWhat segmented offers and experiences are being implementedSTATS:ARPDAUdX retentionEngagement %Payer PercentSession lengthDOW frequencyAllocated Grants: Performance Based MilestonesIt’s important to keep in mind the complexity and scale of games varies game-by-game. Below are ranges based on averages:Phase 1 - Game DevelopmentThis phase is critical where all foundations of the game are set in place and initial benchmarks for performance are established. If the game design and tooling are not setup properly during this phase the game will struggle to reach break-even.A grant of $100,000 to $1.5M is recommended depending on the scope and state of the project.Phase 2 + 3 - Alpha/Closed Beta and Open BetaPhases two and three are intertwined with their shared focuses on refinement and optimization. It’s during these phases that positive unit economics must be achieved before launching and scaling the game.A grant of $250,000 to $500,000 is recommended which is lower than phase one because this phase is focused on refinement.Phase 4 + 5 - Game Launch and GrowthThese phases are both intertwined as they’re focused on launch and sustainable growth. It’s critical that as the game scales it’s continuously optimized to reduce the cost to acquire users while increasing their lifetime value.A grant of +$1.5M is recommended which is the highest given the majority is allocated to launch and user acquisition.1600×898 258 KBOpportunities and Next StepsThe Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) is a model to rapidly accelerate Arbitrum’s support for game builders and also strategically allocate funding and resources towards vetted experts to help accelerate the onboarding and go-to-market of the best builders in the gaming industry.Learn more:Open DraftForum Post [TBD]Working Group on Telegram"

We hope these key statistics will help shape future iterations of campaigns and pave the way to an even more fruitful partnership with Gitcoin.This report serves as the deliverable for Milestone 2 of the Firestarters Grant awarded to the Forse Team.Key TakeawaysThrive-powered rounds on Arbitrum performed better than similar rounds in Ethereum and other L2s, with an efficiency score of 0.237.Thrive-powered rounds had the second best Gini coefficient of 0.559, indicating more equal rounds in terms of donation sizes.Thrive-powered rounds displayed increased consistency in terms of engagement across donation periods, likely driven by effective off-chain campaigns.All in all, Thrive-powered rounds showcased higher average donations across profiles, with gamers contributing $4.839 on average, second only to Ethereum.CoverageThis report aims to analyze the outcomes of the Gitcoin-Arbitrum Partnership, with focus on Thrive Protocol’s facilitation and the Thank ARB campaign, from August, 2023 to March, 2024.Limitations and Additional ConsiderationsGiven the complexities of the gitcoin data landscape, all data points utilized in this analysis were produced from an aggregation of data obtained from the following data sources:Open Source Observatory (OSO),Gitcoin regendata.xzy,Official Gitcoin graphQL endpoints.However, during the analysis, we identified minor discrepancies between the different data sets utilized. Therefore,all numbers are subject to a small error margin.With regards to impact on key on-chain network metrics, the lack of a standardized reporting framework for initiatives with considerable off-chain components constitutes a blocker to the accurate calculation of impact metrics. This is further aggravated by the fact that a majority of the projects funded within the scope of the analyzed partnership were to be executed off-chain.Thrive as a ChainFor the purpose of this analysis, we considered Thrive-powered rounds as if they were a chain in order to effectively generate cross-chain comparisons. “Arbitrum” values exclude all “Thrive-powered” rounds.Gitcoin-Arbitrum Partnership AnalysisArbitrum Dominance in Gitcoin’s ActivityAs mentioned in a previous report, there’s a clear dominance of Arbitrum as the network to run rounds, with 87% of the rounds in Q2 2024 executed in Arbitrum, this perfectly aligns with the commencement of the formal partnership between both ecosystems, with Thrive Protocol as facilitator.1589×889 107 KBEfficiency of Thrive-Powered RoundsDefinitionsRound EfficiencyFor the purpose of this analysis, Round Efficiency is defined as the ratio of total funds obtained from donations to the matching pool size. Rounds with higher efficiency will effectively amass a higher amount to be distributed across the projects participating in the round, increasing the total amounts allocated to the projects in the round. A lower efficiency ratio would signal that the round was not able to attract meaningful donations and that most of the funds distributed come from the matching pool.Example: A round with 50,000 tokens in the matching pool and 25,000 tokens in total donation value has an efficiency score of 0.5 (i.e. 50% efficient). Whereas a round with 50,000 tokens in the matching pool, and 100,000 in total donation value has an efficiency score of 2 (i.e. 200% efficient).Efficiency AnalysisThrive-powered rounds in Arbitrum had an efficiency score of 0.237, performing better than rounds executed in Ethereum, and well above rounds in Arbitrum (non-Thrive) and Polygon. However, it still ranks far behind from rounds in Optimism, which yielded an efficiency score of 0.443.1589×889 109 KBAdjusting by round size, and only considering rounds similarly sized to the ones executed by Thrive, we can observe that Ethereum obtains a slightly higher efficiency score than the Thrive-powered rounds (+0.04 difference in favor of Ethereum).1589×889 103 KBIf we ignore the rounds and only consider the total donation value relative to the total size of all matching pools by chain we can see some significant variations in the efficiency scores in most chains but Thrive-powered and Ethereum. This suggests that Thrive-powered rounds are, in fact, more consistent in their performance. In contrast with other chains whose efficiency scores are highly influenced by key rounds with extremely good efficiency but that cannot consistently attract the same level of donations.1589×889 110 KBDonation EqualityDefinitionsGini Coefficient as a way to measure donation equalityCore to the Gitcoin ethos, and by design, Gitcoin rounds aim to inspire and incentivize as many individuals as possible to donate to as many projects as possible as a way to gauge interest and demand and democratically fund those projects that matter the most to the community.In this context, the gini coefficient presents itself as an effective way to measure if many similar sized donations have occurred within a round, in alignment with the beforehand mentioned core concepts. A lower Gini coefficient indicates more donation equality, whereas a higher coefficient indicates the presence of higher variations in donation sizes.Equality AnalysisThrive-powered rounds in Arbitrum had a Gini coefficient of 0.559, performing better than rounds executed in all other chains where Gitcoin is available but Ethereum (only by a slim margin of 0.004 in favor of Ethereum).1589×889 120 KBIf we ignore the rounds and only consider the total donation value relative to the total size of all matching pools by chain we can observe that Gini coefficients move towards 1, indicating a higher inequality across the board. Nevertheless, the aggregated total donations from Thrive-powered rounds still were more equal in size than other donations in Arbitrum (0.67 vs 0.711).1589×889 119 KBDonation Timeline AnalysisDefinitionsDonation TimelineThe Donation timeline represents the activity of users that donated over the progress of the round. In order to achieve comparable data, all donation activity is relativized to its start and end date. This allows us to plot it as a function of round completion 0%-100% by participating projects. In the heatmap-like graph, green areas indicate activity (donation) and the red “dot” indicates the point where 50% of the donations had happenedDonation Timeline CurvesThis curve graphically represents the aggregation of donations as a function of the project completion rate. Fundamentally, it shows when donations are made throughout the completion of the project’s donation rounds. In other words, it highlights when most donations happened, early or late relative to a normalized donation period. A straight line indication that donation came in uniformly over the donation period.Timeline AnalysisAt first glance, we can observe a congregation of activity aligned for many projects. This suggests similar donation periods (determined by the round in which these were included), but also highlights that activity follows a pattern, possibly aligned with off-chain events, such as social media pushes and activation. There’s also an apparent correlation with higher Total Donated Amounts and clustering of Median activity towards the end of the donation period.In future analysis, it’d be interesting to collect and overlay such events and advertising efforts to evaluate correlations.Sorting by Median1600×898 378 KBSorted by Round Donation Period Start1600×898 365 KBSorted by Total Amount Donated (low to high)1600×898 383 KBDonation Timeline CurvesAs mentioned in the definitions above, we are able to plot a donation characteristic curve that graphically represents when most donations happen. Off all the chains observed, Thrive-powered rounds stand out for displaying high uniformity in donation through the majority of the donation period, with a spike as rounds reach their final moments of the donation period. On the contrary, zkSync and other more novel L2s stand out due to their tendency to have many donations early in the donation period.All in all, the donation characteristic curve of Thrive-powered rounds suggest a constant and ongoing engagement with the participating Gitcoin projects, most likely due to frequent off-chain activations, such as social media outreaches and campaigns.1589×889 170 KBDonor AnalysisDefinitionsProfilesFor this analysis, we segmented the donors into one of five “profiles” based on the users’ past interactions with over 3.5 million labeled contracts, across multiple chains. The profiles utilized in this analysis are: “NFT Enthusiasm”, “Dapp User”, “Gamer”, “DeFi Degen”, and “Trader”.For more information on how we segment users on their on-chain activity, please refer to this page in the Forse Docs Site.Distribution of Donors by ProfilesAt first glance, we can observe that the distribution of donations by profile of Thrive-powered rounds is almost the same across all major chains where Gitcoin is deployed, with only minor (single digit percentage) differences.Notably, Polygon has a considerably larger share of participation (unique donations) from the “trader” profile than the other chains and Thrive-powered rounds (50% vs 25-35% range).1600×900 83.1 KB1600×900 82.3 KB1600×900 80.8 KB1600×900 82.1 KB1600×900 83.3 KBDistribution of Total Donations by SegmentAt first glance, we can observe that the distribution of total donation by profile of Thrive-powered rounds is almost the same across all major chains where Gitcoin is deployed, with only minor (single digit percentage) differences.It is worth noting that Thrive-powered rounds in gitcoin in general have over double the relative participation of Gamers in the total donations compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum (2.84% vs. 1.25%), considerable higher than other L2s (1.55% for Optimism and 1.92% for Polygon), and slightly above Ethereum (2.49%).1600×900 81.4 KB1600×900 81.5 KB1600×900 81.3 KB1600×900 81.7 KB1600×900 82 KBAverage Donations by ProfileWhen analyzing the average donation across chains and profiles, we observe that Thrive-powered rounds effectively engaged donors and encouraged high-value contributions, particularly among the “gamer” profile segment, slightly higher than the same segment in Arbitrum, but also the second-highest among all chains after Ethereum.While rounds in Ethereum are in the lead in terms of average across most profiles segments, Thrive-powered rounds consistently outperformed other L2s, suggesting Thrive’s effectiveness when it comes to the implementation of donor engagement strategies.NetworkGamerDefi DegenDapp UserTraderNFT EnthusiastzkSync Era$2.817$2.376$1.920$1.833$1.682Optimism$2.806$2.274$1.475$1.827$1.319Arbitrum$4.474$3.262$3.191$3.011$1.569Ethereum$11.600$4.827$4.858$3.705$2.577Polygon$2.414$1.238$1.190$0.394$0.696Base$1.781$1.552$1.235$1.814$0.794Thank ARB$4.839$2.285$2.751$2.114$1.202Celo$3.274$3.683$3.492$3.428$1.009Avalanche$1.517$4.068$3.494$4.797$2.099Metis-$7.215-$28.085$1.642Lukso-$2.947---Fantom---$0.047-1589×889 120 KBConclusionsAll in all, the analysis highlights several positive aspects of the partnership between the Arbitrum Ecosystem and Gitcoin. Thrive-powered rounds have demonstrated relative efficiency and consistency, falling only behind Ethereum in most analyses. This sets a positive tone for future initiatives and contributes to solidifying Arbitrum’s dominance within the Gitcoin ecosystem.⁤⁤While measuring impact in on-chain network metrics still remains a challenge due to difficulties associated with the absence of a standardized reporting framework for initiatives with considerable off-chain components, leveraging underlying strategies beneath these positive outcomes will likely further enhance the outcome of future rounds within the Gitcoin-Arbitrum Partnership."

Building on the success of the GovHack held earlier in Denver, this Brussels edition aimed to elevate the community’s engagement and solidify Arbitrum’s position as a leading force in decentralized governance.Background and MotivationGovHack Brussels was strategically scheduled to take place on July 5-7, 2024, just before one of the most significant Ethereum-centric events, ETHcc, in Brussels. This timing was chosen to maximize the impact of the event, ensuring that Arbitrum had a strong presence during a crucial gathering of the Ethereum community.The success of the Denver event (GovHack Denver Impact Report) had already demonstrated the value of in-person collaborations in fostering innovation and strengthening the network of contributors, delegates, and service providers within the DAO.Hack Humanity, the organiser of both GovHack events, secured $309k in funding from the Arbitrum DAO to execute this initiative (actual funds spent $262k detailed in the finances section of this report).The DAO voted 99% in favour of producing GovHack and continuing the tradition that started in Denver.The goal was to leverage the momentum gained from the Denver event, while expanding the scope and ambition for Brussels. This included a larger prize pool, the introduction of a subsidy pool for high-value contributors, and enhanced community engagement through a dedicated afterparty and a community showcase day.Objectives of GovHack BrusselsThe primary objectives of GovHack Brussels were to:Strengthen Trust and Relationships: Build deeper connections between Arbitrum contributors and foster a high-trust environment essential for decentralized governance.Ideation and Implementation: Encourage the creation and eventual implementation of innovative proposals that could benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.Attract New Talent: Position Arbitrum as the go-to platform for new and existing talent to build and contribute to the DAO’s growth and success.Enhance Brand and Community Presence: Ensure that Arbitrum maintains a strong and influential presence at industry-leading events, particularly those focused on Ethereum, to continue attracting users, developers, and key contributors.GovHack Brussels was designed not just as a standalone event, but as a critical step in a broader strategy to cultivate a resilient, innovative, and inclusive ecosystem and sustainable DAO. By focusing on in-person interactions and providing a structured environment for proposal development, the event aimed to produce tangible outcomes that would drive the DAO forward.In the following sections, this report will delve into the specific outcomes of GovHack Brussels, examining how it met its objectives and the impact it had on the Arbitrum community and ecosystem.MethodologyImplementation ProcessGovHack Brussels 2024 employed a comprehensive and structured approach designed to maximize the potential for innovative governance proposals within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The event was built upon a series of carefully planned activities to identify key challenges, facilitate collaboration, and guide teams through the proposal development process.Pre-Event Mapathons: The event preparation began with two virtual mapathons, strategically scheduled across different time zones to ensure broad participation. These sessions provided a platform for participants to express their concerns, hopes, and brainstorm potential problems and solutions. The ideas generated were clustered, prioritized, and organized into thematic tracks, which were then explored through SWOT analyses and challenge statements developed in breakout rooms.1600×796 165 KB1238×624 131 KBAccess the recordings and Miro boards from the mapathons:Mapathon Round 1 - recording - Jun 17 04 PM CETMapathon Round 2 - Jun 26 10 AM CETCombined resultsTrack Identification and Participant Alignment: The mapathon process led to the identification of ten key tracks, each aligned with the most pressing needs of the DAO.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of representation from the African continent and the Global South.Participant Roles:883×509 13.7 KBAttendees primarily identified as Builders, Contributors, and Service Providers, indicating that GovHack attracts individuals who are not only interested in contributing to the DAO but are also focused on building and enhancing its ecosystem.The significant presence of Delegates underscores GovHack’s importance as a forum for deepening IRL feedback and fostering stronger connections among established DAO contributors.Participant Experience1600×904 206 KB1600×898 182 KB1600×904 147 KBDetailed IRL schedule here.Arbitrum’s goal of fostering an ecosystem that thrives on open innovation, interoperability, user choice, and healthy competition was clearly reflected in the participant experiences at GovHack Brussels:Overall Sentiment:The general sentiment during Day 1 was overwhelmingly positive, with participants using words like “fun,” “inclusive,” and “connected” to describe their experience. By Day 2, the focus shifted to words like “intense,” “productive,” and “impactful,” reflecting the rigorous work and networking that characterized the event.DAY 11069×552 41.7 KBDAY 21041×499 38 KBSocial Connectivity:On Day 1, most attendees reported knowing few people within the ecosystem. However, by the end of Day 2, participants had significantly expanded their networks, with many reporting they had met between 6 and 15 new people. This increase in social connections was facilitated by structured networking exercises and track explorations.Quotes from participants like Cliffton highlight the value of in-person interactions:“Having a lot of in real life feedback, a lot of in-person iterations and improvements, is a big value add… We found out that the main takeaways from the DAO was that everyone just got to know each other better, everyone could collaborate on a quicker pace.”625×585 29.6 KBSkill Development and Confidence BuildingGovHack also played a crucial role in enhancing the proposal-making skills and confidence of participants:1029×497 46.1 KBConfidence in Proposal Success:Participants’ confidence in getting their proposals passed increased from an average of 6.4 on Day 1 to 7.0 on Day 2, marking a 9.4% improvement. This boost was attributed to the expert feedback and educational talks provided during the event.As Raam noted, “I think the quality of the proposals that we saw at GovHack were probably equivalent to one month of progress for a typical proposal that’s worked on remotely.”DAY 11059×508 18.9 KBDAY 21021×406 13.8 KBQuotes from ParticipantsThe positive feedback from participants underscores the value that GovHack added to the Arbitrum ecosystem:Disruption Joe: “The DAO is really spearheading the evolution of decentralized technology and governance. And we’re seeing this governance innovation live in action here at GovHack.”Srijith: “GovHack makes it super easy if you’re not a coder because there is a lot of value that you can add based on your experience… Bringing us together makes it a lot easier for us to move the DAO forward.”@ocandocrypto: “I’m feeling excited just for the fact that I’ve been learning a lot. So it’s quite exciting, this real experience of sharing with others and also learning from others.”These qualitative results highlight GovHack Brussels 2024 as a pivotal event that not only fostered collaboration and innovation but also strengthened the social fabric and skill sets within the Arbitrum community.FinancesThe original proposal was executed with $309k, including contingencies.The final costs come in at $262kOriginal estimates:1416×1408 127 KB1424×294 31.4 KBHack Humanity received Milestone 1 & 2, we did not request Milestone 3 payment ($46,350) the final 15% as it was not needed.Note the plan was to distribute $10k (20 x $500) scholarships, we awarded 20 scholarships, yet 5 people didn’t show up or were in eligible, the final scholarship spend was $7,500.Scholarship winners announcement 1Scholarship winners announcement 2Actual costs1600×1114 259 KBUnderspent $1096 returned from Hack Humanity wallet to GovHack mutlisigArbiscan transactionRemainder in GovHack Multisig:1600×427 64.8 KBThis can be used towards GovHack Devcon to secure a Bangkok venue early, or returned to the DAO main treasury.Recommendations for Future EventsBased on the challenges faced and feedback received, several recommendations were made to enhance future GovHack events:Increase Prize Amounts:To encourage a greater variety of projects, it was suggested to increase the prize pool and consider separating prizes by track. This would ensure that all tracks are well-represented and encourage more focused project development.Change the number of TracksWe had 10 tracks, while that meant we had a breadth of engagement, was that at the cost of depth of engagement. We could do the next GovHack to a much greater depth say on 3 tracks that are top priorities for the DAO for that quarter for instance.Larger Scholarships:The $500 scholarships provided were not sufficient for participants travelling from outside Europe. One major delegate suggested increasing the scholarship amount to $2,500 per participant while curating the talent pool more selectively would better support the participation of high-value contributors. Ideal 20 x $2,500.Workshops on Grants:More workshops focused explicitly on available grants and the application process would help participants better navigate the funding landscape and increase the quality of their proposals.Venue Considerations:While the venue was generally well-received, future events should take into account the proximity to related conferences, like EthCC, to make it more convenient for participants.Post GovHack SupportFacilitated program to support promising proposals to continue development and submission to the DAO. I.e. run online PitStops, schedule dedicated guidance and feedback sessions per track aspiring contributors can engage with. Ideal a dedicated 4 week online support/incubation programTarget demographics and IRL program design considerationsGovHack was conceived and created by Hack Humanity for the following purposes:1. onboarding of new talent to solve issues for the DAO with proposals, success measures being increasing the quantity and quality of proposals.2. onboarding and development of existing and new delegates to exercise their role live realtime guiding and providing feedback to teams writing proposals3. a space for delegates and core contributors to network, build high trust relationships and make core complex DAO level decision makingWe assess that GovHack is doing 1 and 2 well, point 3 in particular complex DAO level decision-making isn’t something intentionally designed for in the program and facilitation, people in the DAO are showing up and defacto using GovHack in this way in the absence of a dedicated opportunity to fulfil that need.We have had 2 iterations of GovHack, I’d like to ideate with feedback here on what the 3rd iteration of GovHack needs to be most serving.The possibility to eitherhave a dual track of strategic facilitation for delegates and core contributors to work through hard problems and make decisionsuse Day 1 as a mini offsite for delegates and core contributors with the support of structured facilitation to work through complex topics and make critical decisions, to sharpen up the most aligned tracks and challenge statements, then move to the hackathon with this enhanced clarityBy reflecting on these challenges and the lessons learned, GovHack can continue to evolve and improve, ensuring that future events provide even greater value to participants and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.Conclusion1078×375 8.33 KBArbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024 showcased the powerful role in-person events play in sparking innovation and enhancing decentralized governance. With more than 200 participants from 16 countries, the event provided a fertile ground for turning ideas into actionable proposals.The event’s well-organized structure, featuring pre-event mapathons, expert pitstops, and educational panels, gave participants the tools they needed to navigate the complex process of developing proposals. By focusing on key areas relevant to the DAO’s goals, the event ensured that contributions were both meaningful and impactful. The democratic approach to judging and community voting highlighted a strong commitment to fostering genuine innovation.Participants were highly satisfied, as evidenced by a Net Promoter Score of 83 and robust social media engagement. However, the real highlight was the personal connections and sense of community that emerged—something often lacking in virtual environments.The insights gained, especially around the timing of educational sessions and team formation, will be invaluable for future events. As Arbitrum continues to grow, the lessons and networks established at GovHack Brussels will be instrumental in shaping the DAO’s future. This event underscored the importance of in-person engagement in driving decentralized governance forward, setting a new benchmark for community-driven innovation.HackHumanity has thoroughly enjoyed producing GovHacks and wishes to continue this tradition providing GovHacks as a key competitive advantage for Arbitrum.Have added a Quick Poll for future direction, feedback much appreciated → PollAdditional ResourcesTo explore more about the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024, including videos, proposals, photos, and media coverage, please refer to the following links:After-Movie: Watch the 4-minute after-movieProposal Submissions: View all proposals on the Arbitrum Forum GovHack sectionAll media playlistMapathon Recordings and Miro Boards:Mapathon Round 1 - recording - Jun 17 04 PM CETCombined resultsDaily Recaps:Day 1 Recap | 34K views | 51 reposts | 270 likesDay 2 Recap | 21K views | 22 reposts | 62 likesDay 3 Recap | 1.9K views | 13 reposts | 49 likesPhotos: Access all pictures from the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024"

With this lite report, we aim to provide a better understanding of how Gitcoin and Jokerace impact community engagement, drive growth, and generate lasting effects in the Arbitrum Ecosystem.These are our preliminary research findings, which will be expanded upon in subsequent deliveries. This report serves as the deliverable for Milestone 1.Key TakeawaysArbitrum’s Dominance in Gitcoin Rounds: Arbitrum has positioned itself as the dominant network for Gitcoin rounds, with 87% of all rounds in Q2 2024 happening here. Making it the current preferred choice for funding and community engagement initiatives within the Gitcoin ecosystem, likely due to the Thrive-powered partnership between both ecosystems.Strong Donation Participation Despite Lower Averages: Although Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds have a 63% lower average donation compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum, this is skewed by large outliers. Thrive rounds excel in generating consistent donations, with +50% more contributions at the 50th and 75th percentiles, indicating strong community engagement. Recommendation: Keep broad participation while exploring how to attract larger donations to further increase impact.“Younger” Audience Engagement: Thrive-powered rounds attracted, on average, younger accounts to Gitcoin. Potentially indicating the onboarding of new users into the Gitcoin ecosystem. Recommendation: Continue to develop initiatives that generate new users, while also working towards the retention of these users as they mature in the ecosystem.Participation Patterns in Gitcoin Rounds: Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds show a “mid-participation period” spike in activity, unlike the general trend of being skewed toward the end of the round participation period. It would appear that Thrive-powered rounds are effective in engaging participants earlier in the process.Jokerace’s Short-lived Success on Arbitrum: While Jokerace saw a peak in activity on Arbitrum during Thrive initiatives, this activity was not sustained and quickly shifted to other networks, mostly Base. This suggests that this activity was heavily dependent on activations, with limited sustained organic growth. Recommendation: Explore new ways of integrating Jokerace into the Arbitrum ecosystem to make its use more organic rather than Thrive-driven.Social Reach of Thrive-Powered Jokerace Contests: Thrive-powered contests on Jokerace achieved significant social media reach, particularly on Twitter/X, almost hitting 100K users. However, this reach was concentrated in a few key participants. Recommendation: Explore new strategies to get more Key Opinion Leaders, or incentivize broader sharing to reduce the reliance on a few key players.Current LimitationsThis analysis offers preliminary conclusions. Data analyzed for this report is limited to the end of Q2 2024 when the initiatives ended. Jokerace data has been decoded as much as possible and reflects an accurate approximation of reality, however only the listed chains have been taken into account.GitcoinWe focused our analysis on 3 main areas:Impact of the Arbitrum-Gitcoin partnership in the context of the pluralistic grants framework.Characteristics of Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.Characteristics of users engaging with Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.Gitcoin Activity by Network, Arbitrum is KingGitcoin has been one of the preferred bounties platforms in the EVM ecosystem. Under the Pluralistic Grants Framework, Gitcoin was used as a channel to spur growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, facilitating contributions to open-source projects and generating exposure to a vast community of dedicated developers.If we take a look at the distribution of Gitcoin Rounds based on the network they were run on, we can see the dominance of Arbitrum as the network to run the rounds, 87% of the rounds in Q2 2024 were executed in Arbitrum. This aligns with campaigns executed by Thrive in Gitcoin.1589×889 107 KBAlthough all-time data shows a decrease in Gitcoin rounds since Q4 2021, likely aligned with the sentiment at the macro-level and the onset of the current bear market.1589×889 169 KBGitcoin Rounds on ArbitrumAnlalyzing Gitcoin activity on Arbitrum reveals that USD $235,000 were donated during the period analyzed. Of this, only 22% is directly tied to Thrive initiatives, with the remaining 78% corresponding to non-Thrive related rounds.Focusing on Thrive related rounds, we observe smaller donation amounts, averaging $2.12 (with 75% of the donations below $1.16). In comparison, non-Thrive rounds had an average donation 63% higher, around $3.46 (with 75% of the donations below $2).RoundsThrivenon-ThriveDeltaTotal Donations$52,911.00$182,743.0029%Avg.

Donation Count15526459%50% - percentile9158157%75% - percentile221133166%Highest12221233110%As we can see, while Thrive only had 60% of the gitcoin round average in terms of donation count, this is laregly due to very large outliers in some Gitcoin rounds (12k+ donations). However, looking at the 50th and 75th percentile - representing how many donations at least 50%/75% of the projects receive - we see that Thrive is outperforming the other gitcoin rounds significantly by over 50. This suggests that Thrive created very homogenous rounds with consistently high donation counts, aligning with Gitcoin’s foundational principles.In terms of participation, Thrive rounds showed a somewhat even distribution among the top 30 projects (between 400 and 500 donations). Total donation amounts display a different distribution, evidencing a noticeable gap between the top 3 projects and the runner-ups.It is worth to note that the Arbitrum DAO Delegates project received the highest donation count overall, totalling over 1.2k donations, and ranked 3rd in terms of total donation amounts1589×889 245 KB1589×889 226 KBWhich Users Are Engaging?If we take a look at the the users participating in the rounds executed during the analyzed time range, we can see that Thrive-related Rounds appeal to a “younger” audience, compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum. This suggests that Thrive Protocol efforts efforts are successfully onboarding new users into the Gitcoin ecosystem and contributing to community development.The average age of Gitcoin users participating in Thrive-related rounds is 574 days (approximately 1 year and 7 months), whereas for non-Thrive rounds, it’s around 1 year and 8 months (608 days). It’s worth noting that these averages are highly skewed and to get a better understanding we need to break the users by the time they join Gitcoin.1589×889 118 KB1589×889 137 KBWe also performed a time-based activity analysis to identify if there were any patterns in the way users interacted with the Gitcoin rounds and if there were any specific patterns that could be leveraged to maximize impact.The first thing that becomes evident is that activity is skewed towards the end of the participation period. However, a closer look at Thrive-related rounds reveals a slight difference: while similar overall, these rounds display an activity spike towards the middle of the participation time. This indicates better performance in activating Gitcoin users and inspiring them to participate early.1589×889 331 KB|923.1074380165288x5021600×873 113 KBJokeraceJokerace is an on-chain contest platform allowing monetization opportunities and reputation building. It’s positioned as a great tool for grants, hackathons, governance, and community-driven decision-making.We focused our analysis for Jokerace utilization in the context of Thrive-powered initiatives on 2 main areas:Arbitrum’s Dominance in Jokerace;Social Reach of Thrive-powered Jokerace Contests on Arbitrum.Arbitrum Dominance in JokeraceUnlike Gitcoin, Jokerace’s activity on Arbitrum was not sustained and is directly tied to Thrive initiatives. Examining total events by network shows Arbitrum had a spike in activity during Q3 2024, but it rapidly declined as Thrive activations concluded and Base activity surged. At its peak (Feb 2024), Arbitrum accounted for over 56% of Jokerace activity.1589×889 144 KBDuring this Arbiturm activity peak, we noticed that most votes were cast without proof. Further analysis is needed to understand the implications of this outcome.1589×889 90.4 KBSocial Reach of Jokerace Contest on ArbitrumTo analyze reach, we used the Jokerace Contest winners’ social media data as a proxy. At a general level, the first thing that becomes evident is that Thrive-powered contests performed exceptionally well on Twitter/X, reaching over 98.9K users on this platform, making it the dominant channel for activation. This was likely aided by the fact that most projects were Twitter/X focused or leveraged this platform to engage with participants.1600×896 111 KBIn terms of the projects themselves, Thrive-powered contests manage to activate a handful of participants with decently sized Twitter/X accounts. Nevertheless, distribution is heavily skewed and concentrated in a reduced group of participants with very big reach and then falling off sharply. Being the bigger “Data Muse” with 25.3K followers and “Smol Age: Dawn of New Age” with 23.4K followers.1600×897 154 KBConclusion⁤This surface-level analysis of the Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds and Jokerace contests on the Arbitrum network offers some initial insights into the effectiveness and impact of these initiatives. And while there are signs of success, a more rigorous impact measurement is also needed to ensure that resources are effectively driving meaningful growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.⁤We at Forse are more than happy to participate in discussions around the design and implementation of a more comprehensive impact measurement framework. ⁤⁤By doing so, Arbiturm would ensure that all funded projects are held accountable for delivering measurable results, ⁤not only improving decision-making and resource allocation but also building greater trust and support within the community."

With the DAO’s adoption of the framework, delegates allocated 50M ARB in grants across 30 protocols, spurred by over 100 applications from diverse Arbitrum projects.As the DAO explores initiatives to adjust, extend, and amend STIP, it’s worth weighing the efforts spent on rectifying its flaws against the potential of fostering a vision for more forward-looking, sustainable frameworks. The promise of STIP was a compromise to provide potentially shitty network incentives, with the hope that future investments would prioritize values like long-term growth, user retention, and capital efficiency.As a largely neutral party, I’ve observed current discourse within the DAO mostly revolves around amending the shortcomings of STIP based on arguments of inclusion and equality. This post aims to frame an entirely different philosophy, positing a shift towards excellence and rigor via grant infrastructure designed primarily to tactically and meaningfully allocate DAO resources towards programs that maximize long-term growth.A Long-Term ApproachBefore STIP’s inception, @raho and I spent months analyzing incentives programs, trolling data and forums, to better understand their impact on long-term growth and capital efficiency. While unable to find robust evidence that incentives are an efficacious long-term solution to growth, we often observed their efficacy to attract both users and capital to protocols and ecosystems in short-term periods, and in some cases drive retention.This is not a novel discovery, but rather context for how the discussions between protocols, delegates, and stakeholders might proceed. As data from STIP comes in, the goal should be to not just make more decisions, for more projects, over more time, for more ARB…the goal should be to increase Arbitrum DAO’s investment in the ecosystem with the benefits of meaningful hindsight, and ambitious foresight. We should look to improve not just the consensus mechanism (direct voting = never again) of incentive programs, but the fabric of incentive design, analysis and efficacy.As evidenced by STIP, the objectives set during a program’s design phase critically shape its outcomes. In this context, it feels worthwhile to take a step back to observe a simplistic, but hopefully meaningful philosophy to grants, incentives, and growth.Grants Programs: A Principled ApproachARB delegates are responsible for fostering, developing, authorizing, and governing the Arbitrum DAO-governed chains. These governors also maintain the power to allocate and manage all protocol revenue, currently collected by the sequencer and transferred to the DAO treasury.Assuming Arbitrum network longevity and growth are goals of the DAO, supporting activities that increase sustainable network usage is a meaningful objective for the DAO to pursue. As a proxy for usage, many observe sequencer revenue on the network. Optimism’s RPGF Flywheel has gone so far as incorporating sequencer revenue as the engine of a development flywheel to ensure the network’s long-term health.Using sequencer revenue as a signal for network usage, we can observe that Arbitrum generates revenue via fees, observing which predefined stakeholders from the Arbitrum Foundation pay these fees may help inform avenues for grant funding.These stakeholders hold the potential to drive sequencer fees either directly, through usage of the network, or indirectly, via parameter changes and technical developments that might increase network usage by making the platform more attractive to protocols and users. For this exercise, we’ll observe the stakeholders that most directly impact revenue, defining them as:Network Stakeholders: Chains (ex., Arbitrum One and Nitro) use the DAO sequencer to settle transactions to the Ethereum mainnet.Application Stakeholders: Applications on Arbitrum chains facilitate transactions to the DAO sequencer on behalf of their users.User Stakeholders: Users utilize the DAO sequencer to transact, exchange, or use dApps to settle transactions.Currently, most grant discussions have focused on these direct revenue generators, a motive which is likely appropriate for the Arbitrum DAO’s growth stage. The existing grants programs can be broadly broken into three categories of grant funding:Ecosystem Development Grants: Grants that support the development of products, tools, and services that leverage the Arbitrum network to achieve their goals.Ecosystem Incentive Grants: Grants that support the usage of products, tools, and services that are built upon the Arbitrum network.Internal Development Grants: Grants that support the development of internal resources with the intent of increasing the growth of the Arbitrum network (this could include the administration costs, data programs, etc.).When it comes to grants, we can also observe popular distribution strategies:Development Grants: Grants allocated towards community builders for pre-defined scopes of work.Incentive Grants: Incentive grants distribute tokens to protocols, who subsidize usage of the network when interacting with a particular project or protocol, usually in the form of rewards, rebates, etc.Bounties: Objective-driven Grants require community stakeholders or grant administrators to define explicit objectives. Prospective grantees can achieve these objectives, and receive a bounty grant for doing so.Retroactive Grants: Completed projects are reviewed based on their impact and granted after completion.Incubation: A mentorship program to support and foster early-stage development until participating projects acquire sufficient resources to function independently.A Role for IncentivesIncentives are one tool. They’re both fleeting and immediately impactful. As such, they are likely better treated as a spice, rather than a main ingredient. To help further contextualize a potential role for incentives, observing each stakeholder bucket in greater detail can help highlight lessons and further determine the efficacy of incentives for growth:1. Arbitrum Network StakeholdersArbitrum Orbit enables permissionless deployment of new Layer-3 and the Constitution empowers the Arbitrum DAO to permit new Layer-2 chains. The demand for rollup chains is clear as Coinbase, Lens, and Worldcoin have all committed to building on Optimism’s OP Stack architecture.Due to the technical requirements for launching a layer-3 or layer-2 chain, one might expect the Foundation and Offchain Labs to play a critical role in facilitating many layer-3 relationships moving forward. As such, the DAO might consider familiarizing itself with the Foundation’s roadmap, objectives, and recruitment strategies to identify blind spots.That said, avenues also exist for the DAO to both support and fund Arbitrum Network Stakeholders:Development fund for new L3 chains.Development and incubation program for network chains.Analytics, dashboards, and reporting for launched chains.Incentive programs to grow usage across new networks and chains.Retroactive grants for Arbitrum networks that meet performance benchmarks.The community might research and consider what resources, incentives, and technical and financial support could provide to help fund the development of equally robust brand names on the Arbtirum Orbit architecture.2. Application Layer StakeholdersLayer-2s benefit from supporting dApp development more than existing grant programs at the application layer (Aave, Lido, Compound) since applications drive the majority of on-chain fees. As such, the Arbitrum DAO is incentivized to build a robust dApp network.Observing trends in application usage, user retention, and transaction volumes across many networks can provide insight into how Arbitrum might approach dApp growth.Native and Niche ApplicationsAlly Zach, an author of User Retention on Optimism and Arbitrum, discovered some interesting findings including the concept that native applications actually bring sticky user retention. Historically, niche applications that leaned into Arbitrum’s network strengths as a low-cost environment, such as GMX and Radiant Capital, have outperformed non-native applications in user retention.The trend of outperformed user retention can also be observed across alt-L1s, who’ve seen periods of outsized adoption in niche applications such as Lens on Polygon and even Step’N on Solana. When funding dApps, the Arbitrum Grants might emphasize supporting unique, niche, and native applications that provide better user adoption, retention, and transaction volumes, instead of prioritizing the migration of existing applications or forked protocols.Arbitrum-Enabled ApplicationsL2s provide cheaper, faster transactions than Ethereum mainnet. This enables emerging applications that struggled to reach critical adoption on Ethereum layer-1 due to high transaction costs, such as perpetual exchanges, gaming, and decentralized social protocols. One could expect this to enable many new applications and might prefer to see grant funding that supports maverick and novel applications built on this technology rather than merely improved in a low-cost, high-throughput environment.These two characteristics, which encompass niche, native, and tech-aligned solutions, may better retain users than forked or migrated protocols such as similar mid-tier dexes, perps, and lending protocols. Because of the availability of these protocols, data suggests users will chase any increased yield opportunities aggressively, moving funds to farm short-term rewards but being less compelled to stick around once incentives end or begin elsewhere.3. User Layer StakeholdersUser adoption programs have existed long before crypto including deals and rewards programs at your local ice cream shop. They also have proven effective in driving adoption for new products, technologies, and services. For L2s, user adoption is often structured via rebates or incentives.Rebates aim to help subsidize a portion of a network’s transaction cost by allowing claims of a native governance token, helping decentralize the number of governance token holders. Rebates can be structured in many ways, including a claimable stipend held in a smart contract or retroactively via an airdrop to eligible users. Near Protocol, Optimism, and Avalanche have all conducted notable incentive programs.Given the permissionless nature of blockchains, incentives in crypto are particularly vulnerable to being abused by rent-seekers who use these programs to receive rewards without the intention of returning to the products and services they engage with. Takeaways from Optimism’s Governance Fund distributions help demonstrate how these types of programs can help boost short-term metrics (TVL, transactions, fees) but have a varied impact when looking at long-term, annualized, and post-program metrics. This is not to say incentives are bad, only to suggest that, as a community, Arbitrum can learn from these lessons to design better and more effective incentive programs.A large goal of STIP is to internalize these learnings with data, so the community might improve its decision-making moving forward.Some Areas to Explore:No one knows incentives better than the protocols who deploy them. Many of these takeaways are well known. But from the admin level, the DAO should focus on rewarding designs and programs that embrace efforts to IMPROVE their capital efficiency, and IMPROVE their odds of retention and long-term growth.Better Incentive DesignsIncentive design is a powerful tool to generate user traction. One example: Blur, covered in this case study by Spindl, used a dynamic incentive program that shifted over time, offered expectations for long-term rewards, and focused on siphoning volume and liquidity from competitors. While this aggressive approach may not work for all programs, the DAO should work with incentive program applicants to develop specific strategies that are thesis-driven, measurable and improvable.Designing User ExperienceEducational elements in incentive programs may aid in retaining users. At Optimism Galxe Quests actually far more effective at bringing transaction volumes, and new users, than liquidity mining programs (which brought more capital).Combining these aspects to a more comprehensive UX is worth exploring to further determine the effects of education on future engagement, and adoption. Establishing long-term and recurring reward cycles designed around user experiences should be worth exploring.Liquidity & User DynamicsAn exploration in DeFi, liquidity provider engagement in relation to user engagement, (Supply/Demand analysis) is potentially under-observed. Observations like understanding of what liquidity thresholds are required (at an ecosystem and protocol level) to catalyze meaningful volume or demand for a given asset should be explored as the DAO looks to bring users to Arbitrum in a competitive L2 environment. Specifically, marrying these insights with user behavior and customer preferences would provide meaningful insight in the design of objective based grants for specific tokens/assets (LSTs, stables, etc.).Accountability and TransparencyThe DAO, Foundation, and all open-source organizations should hold standards of transparency and accountability. This includes grant programs. STIP took pains to include this despite the rapid deployment of the program via grant streaming w/ Hedgey and self-reporting requirements. Simple disclosures such as the contract addresses used to disburse incentive funding, incentivized pool addresses, etc. helps dramatically when observing the effect of programs overall.Data InfrastructureWithout the infrastructure to collect meaningful data on the DAO’s programs, it’s nearly impossible for the community to create meaningful impact. In the long-term, dashboards, analytics, and reporting should be required of all incentive programs, whether funded as an internal effort by the DAO or a requirement of participating programs, Optimism Lab’s Analytics program is a great starting point, and Plurality Labs’ work to fund Open Data initiatives are a promising step for Arbitrum.Granular data is also important. Analysis must be conducted on a per asset, per pool, and per protocol basis, to gain meaningful insights for future grant design.image1280×521 30.3 KBOptimizationGreat incentive programs also are willing to iterate by experimenting and optimizing their programs. This can be designed at the grant level with planning by the grant provider. The DAO could guide grantees and ask projects to release their incentives in tranches, measure results against pre-established KPIs and provide rolling optimization to deliver effective results.1412×416 25.4 KBVelodrome, an Optimism-native DEX, has been a leader in evaluating OP incentives. Their program analysis post outlines their evaluation framework and key takeaways. Through diligent research, analysis, and effort they demonstrably improved the value returned per OP over time.For maximum capital efficiency, a robust incentive program would work with grantees to structure objective based grants with metrics and milestones up front, distribution in tranches to measure impact against measurable targets, track performance to identify effective vs. ineffective strategies, build in flexibility to adjust future programs, and perform robust reporting and retroactive impact evaluations to improve future programs for everyone.Governance ImplicationsLost in all this is the actual implications of token distribution on governance. Establishing governance flywheels that analyze claimant participation in governance, their delegation habits, and claimant behavior in general will be essential to ensuring incentive programs align with DAO goals.What Next?The next Arbitrum Incentives Working Group meeting invites all interested stakeholders to help brainstorm, pitch, and ideate on future DAO incentives programs:Incentives Working Group CallTuesday, December 12 · 9:00 – 10:00amTime zone: America/Los_AngelesGoogle Meet joining infoVideo call link: https://meet.google.com/qhw-irji-dcbOr dial: ‪(FR) +33 1 73 08 31 91‬ PIN: ‪537 628 857 2081‬#More phone numbers: https://tel.meet/qhw-irji-dcb?pin=5376288572081As such, I encourage folks to use this thread to pull in examples of successful programs, call out any ignorance in the aforementioned sections, and help make the next iterations of Arbitrum incentives stronger.I also have been brainstorming some conceptual ideas…hoping to get those open for public consideration by eow."

With newly captured data revolving around milestone updates and progress reports from our allocator programs and grantees, we’re evaluating the successes and failures of these programs.This will ultimately lead to ‘cuts’ in our cut/coach/grow process - underperforming programs that fail to reach target milestones will not receive continued funding originally allocated to their program, thus saving the Arbitrum DAO experimental funding that would otherwise be ineffective and wasted.1164×618 236 KBX/Twitter Spaces with M1b Grant ProgramsFor the month of July, we continued Thank ARB’s Grant-a-palooza X/Twitter space series to generate additional awareness and have in-depth conversations with its program managers to cover the projects they’re looking to fund, the funding mechanisms they’ll be using, and how they plan on making an impact within Arbitrum.Cartographer SyndicateReFi in ArbitrumRWA Innovation Grants (RWAIG)Oasis Onchain Quick GrantsFarcaster Builder ProgramGIV-ARB Ecosystem Accelerator ProgramAmplifying Impact ProgramOxcart Delegation ProgramThank ARB Season 11 on Thrive ProtocolThank ARB Season 11, Thriving Arbitrum Summer, is an ongoing season that focuses on supporting our allocator programs and grantees with various contributions that onboard them and their community into the Thank ARB ecosystem.With a little over a month in the season, we’ve captured over 4,800 contributions for the Arbitrum ecosystem and the number will grow rapidly in August as these allocator programs begin funding their grantees, along with Gitcoin Grants 21 round coming around the corner - expect much more activity as these programs get active.More contribution opportunities will launch to continue supporting all of our programs in the growth stage of these experiments.Additionally, we will continue to provide decentralized review opportunities as we evaluate the output, outcomes, and impact of grantees and grant programs.2. Oversight Board & Milestone Delivery TrackingBoard meetingsIn July, we held our monthly Oversight Board meetings. We continued publishing weekly updates on the forum to keep the community in the loop on what was discussed at these board meetings. For transparency, you can listen in to the board meeting and hear what was discussed.Milestones Delivery TrackingOur milestones delivery tracker reflects our weekly progress towards each deliverable of the Thank ARB pluralistic grants program Milestone 1b. Here’s the status of our milestones as of July 31, 2024. Feel free to use the link to the live version to follow along during the month.1600×908 294 KB1600×716 192 KBOne highlight from the month is that after reviewing progress and ongoing efforts of our program allocators, we’re close to cutting an underperforming program. The learnings we gathered from this program is that social media-centered impact is difficult to quantify and without clearly defined milestones it’s much more difficult to quantify value creation.We’ve determined that further funding these efforts will not provide equal or more value back to Arbitrum and the DAO. Once this is finalized and the program has been notified of our decision, we’ll be able to share more details.3. Finances & grant spendingM1 spendingIn July, we paid out a total of ARB 108,764.20 to get one step closer to closing out all Milestone 1 programs. We made the following payments:ARB 100,000.00 to the Pluralistic MEV Research Tooling programARB 7,161.00 to Gitcoin Citizen MatchARB 1,603.20 to the Open Data Community “Permissionless Suggestion Box” programAs of now, the only M1b program spending left is the final disbursement for Grant Ships once they finalize their last milestone. This is delayed due to the amount of development work they needed to do to gain practical insights from improvements made based on their first round of funding grants. There are also a few grantees which we are waiting on milestone updates to make their final payments.You can see which programs still remain open in the program update section above.1600×499 168 KBM1b spendingIn July, we paid out a total of ARB 323,528.00 toward our programs.ARB 1.00 to the Cartographer Syndicate, a grant allocator programARB 240,000.00 to GG20, an ecosystem allocatorARB 33,757.00 for Thank ARB participation incentivesARB 34,770.00 for the Grant Impact Index, mostly going toward rewarding our decentralized reviewersARB 15,000.00 for oversight board per diems1600×727 168 KBI hope you found this monthly update insightful and helpful.

Remember, I’m just a cow.Inspired by a lot of talking, both in telegram and here at ETHcc with protocols and delegates, I thought it could have been interesting to write some random ideas after participating to STIP round 1 on the side of protocol, managing questbook season 1+2 as domain allocator (80+ proposals), being part of UAGP as committee member (100+ proposals), participating to STIP.b on the side of protocol being an advisor on LTIPP + STIP (80+ proposals).Now that the shill is over, we can try to understand a bit more who is involved, what are the desires, and what is not appreciated.We have three stakeholder here: the DAO, the protocols and the users.DAO wants tostimulate growth of the ecosystemhelp good protocolshave easily digestible evaluation of programs and protocolsDAO doesn’t want tothrow money awayhave to deliberate too much on single grantsProtocols want tohave more freedom in incentive usagehave less friction in applying/renewinghave help to understand rules and establish mechanismsProtocols don’t want tohave to negotiate every time to get in a programfeel treated unevenly compared to peers and competitorsUsers want toknow what protocols have incentives and how to participatesUsers don’t want tohave their time wasted in participating in a protocolhave to jump from one protocol/chain to another to chase incentivesLet’s try to see for which of these we have a possible solution and what are the open problemsDAOProblem: DAO wants to stimulate growth of the ecosystem.This is (partially) done through incentive program. But the answer will be as correct as possible only if we establish what growth looks like, and what we want to achieve in arbitrum in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. This is an open question for which there has never been a proper discussion; at the same time, i firmly believe we can’t just look for this answer and wait in the meantime due to the competitive landscape and how fast crypto is.Possible solution: work on short/mid/long term vision, in the meantime keep doing (at least some) incentives, and tailor when there is an answer.Where are we on this? Mostly unsolved: I personally don’t think we have ever analysed this properly.Problem: DAO wants to help good protocols.This can mean a lot of things. One interpretation is to either be more punitive with bad protocols, or rewards good ones, or both. But, beside malicious behaviours, it means tapping into previous question: when you know what you want arbitrum to be in 1/3/5/10 years, you can better understand which protocols are a driver. You also need proper way to measure protocols and data to literally read results.Possible solution: work on short/mid/long term vision + being able to monitor behaviour and analyse data to tailor incentive programs.Where are we on this? Same as previous problem.Problem: DAO wants to have easily digestible evaluation of programs and protocols.This translates in having an entity able to monitor data almost in real time, digest this data, present it in a way that is easy to understand. This also relies on the short/mid/long term vision you have, plus a normalisation of the data compared to the market (again: absolute numbers don’t mean anything).Possible solution: work on short/mid/long term vision + data analysis entity/service provider at constant service of the DAO.Where are we on this? Partially done: we introduced data analysis entities (OBL, Blockworks), but we need a stronger mandate and a more robust method for the analysis.Problem: DAO doesn’t want to throw money away.This is a generic statement, and to me still means understanding the cost of incentives vs the returns, either in metric or in assets. This could mean a few thing: understand KPI growth through alignment of programs with short/mid/long term vision + data analysis entity + constant monitoring of protocols, and potentially enable a fee sharing model with protocols, in which protocol share a portion of the excessive returns generated through the program. On top of this, a “sense check” on how much the DAO wants to spent per year.Possible solution: all of the previous + DAO budget with a bucket for incentives + profit sharing model between DAO and protocols.Where are we on this? Mostly unsolved: only now we are starting to talk about DAO budget, and we never look into profit sharing.Problem: DAO doesn’t want deliberate too much on single grants.This is about creating a mechanism in which there are important, informed decisions every 6 months / 1 year, in which the DAO relies on “experts” (service providers, elected people, others) and just comes when is time to evaluate data + a veto process on single entities.Possible solution: optimistic voting framework + an entity (council/advisors/others) constantly working with protocols.Where are we on this? Partially done: during STIP.b/LTIPP we used both the voting method and the council/advisors, but we definitely need to refine it.PROTOCOLSProblem: protocols want to have more freedom in incentive usage.They need to be more agile in using grants, either cause competitive landscape changes or cause narrative changes or others. While the main north start so far has been using incentives for users, protocols also need to sometime rely on external service provider to properly operate. Mature protocols (—> amount of participations in previous incentive programs for example) should have higher freedom in changing structure of incentives, tunnel up to a certain portion to third parties that are not users and others.Possible solution: a categorisation of protocols based on maturity levels, with promotions/retrocessions based on meaningful events (ie malicious behaviours + rubric aligned with short/mid/long term DAO goals) + data analysis. Potentially, different programs to which you can apply based on the criteria above.Where are we on this? Never discussedProblem: protocols want to have less friction in applying/renewing.This is about having protocols not having to lose their time with infinite discussions, template and compiling data; or, at least, to have to do it once per year or when there are meaningful changes.Possible solution: incentive program with optimistic renewal (ie: 1 month duration, optimistic opt-in for 6 months as long as you have a virtuous behaviour backed by data).Where are we on this? Never discussedProblem: protocols want to have help to understand rules and establish mechanisms.This is about supporting programs constantly, not only during the draft of the proposals, in the lifecycle of the grant.Possible solution: supporting entity (council/advisors/others).Where are we on this? Strangely at a decent point. Protocols were mostly happy about the new structure compared to stip 1 and backfund, but there is a lot of margin for improvement. And we definitely need way more people.Problem: protocols don’t want to have to negotiate every time to get in a program.This is about not having to do the same thing over and over (the goal of protocols is attracting users, not to fill the arbi forum) for the sake of doing it; even tho, partially, some compliance is and will always be required.Possible solution: optimistical opt-in, more streamlined KYC process and data processWhere are we on this? Only partially done with the optimistic vote, but a lot of margin for improvement.Problem: protocols don’t want feel treated unevenly compared to peers and competitors.This is about have clear rules about who can participate to a program(s), why you might get rejected, and also knowing that even if you got rejected now there will be another possibility in a relative short term time (1 month?) to reapply + knowing what to do to reapply successfully.Possible solution: seasoned programs with very short cycles (1 month) and clear rules, plus support also after a rejectionWhere are we on this? Never discussed, and we partially fumbled the bag during LTIPP on this, but we could solve it with better advisor/council/rubric structure.USERSProblem: users want to know what protocols have incentives and how to participates.Users want to have clear info on who will stream incentives, when they will start and end, what are the mechanisms. This doesn’t mean having to lurk in the obscure arbitrum forum and reading applications that are as long as an essay, but potentially have a central hub for info, updated, clear.Possible solution: central website, constantly updated, with all the info, + marketing around these initiatives.Where are we on this? Only partially done. We are moving to arbitrumgrants website, but we need a better structure. And we lack marketing, in general, in our DAO.Problem: users don’t want to have their time wasted in participating in a protocol.This means that if, as a user, i take time to study the landscape, to try a protocol, with also a mechanism for incentives as per the description/proposal, I want to effectively have a result coherent with my expectations.Possible solution: a watchdog of the DAO able to analyse, in almost real time, if the mechanisms advertised by a protocol are effectively the one implementedWhere are we on this? Mostly unsolved: as of now we are analysing protocols’ behaviours post results. It likely requires a lot of time/energy/resources.Problem: users don’t want to jump from one protocol/chain to another to chase incentives.This means knowing that not only, as a user, i can be in arbitrum as my preferred chain, and use that protocol as my preferred one, but also know that incentives, even if in small amount, will always be streamed there (as long as that protocol is aligned with the ecosystem).Possible solution: smaller but constant grant programs.Where are we on this? Never discussed.I’ll stop here and leave with a list of possible solutions/improvements, knowing that this is not only a very subjective list, but also something that can be done in a single day or in a single program. At most, is something to grow into.Define short/mid/long term vision of the DAO and the arbi ecosystemProperly monitor data and behaviour of protocols and users, in a way that is not in absolute numbers but as reflection of the above visionReduce friction in incentive program for DAO, protocols and users through optimistic votes and opt-in, support structure, checkpoints for the DAO to analyse or vetoManage protocols expectation through guidance with supporting structure, frequent renewal, and support in case of rejectionMore freedom based on protocol maturity levelsWatchdog(s) able to detect malicious behaviours almost in real timeData analysis available for DAO and users in a clear way and in a focal point that is not our forumSmaller but potentially constant grant programs, in cycles, with very frequent application windowsFixed yearly budget on initiatives.I am interested in hearing your thoughts: users, delegates and arbi enjoyers."

As you can see, seven programs are completed and paid, three are incomplete and in the process of being paid, and two are still running.Project nameStatusProject ManagerExpected payment completionArbitrum Citizen’s Retro FundingPAIDZer8Arbitrum Co.Lab by RnDAOPAIDRNDaoFirestarters by PLPAIDDisruption JoeQuestbook Support RoundsPAIDZer8Sense and Respond: Thank ARBPAIDMartinGovBoost by PLPAIDDisruption JoeGitcoin Hack on AlloPAIDBuidlboxOpen Data IntelligencePAIDEvan PowellBiggest mini-grants Joke RacePAIDDiana ChenGitcoin MatchComplete - Payment pendingZer8JulyMEV ResearchIn ProgressLexicon GovernanceJulyGrant ShipsIn ProgressDAO MasonsAugust1b Milestone 1b programsRequest for Program ProposalsWe received a whopping 120 program ideas for our RFP process for innovative program ideas, of which 64 (53%) passed our initial screening for spam, scams, and AI generation. We selected 22 applicants to receive a 1,000 ARB planning grant to refine their proposal before making a final selection. We compensated applicants for putting time and resources into designing a good program and hosted two workshops geared towards helping applicants refine their allocation mechanism, metrics, and overall execution plan.As a result, we saw applications that were much improved, geared toward top-level objectives for the Arbitrum Ecosystem as a whole, and oriented toward those ecosystem goals that delegates deem most important for grant programs. We also received overwhelmingly positive feedback that applicants found this process both helpful, educational, and fun! Each application was reviewed by a minimum of 5 of 18 external reviewers sourced from the Arbitrum community. We then selected the eight applicants scoring the highest across four rubrics for funding. The selected programs will run from June to September.We are so excited to be funding the following grant programs Amplifying Impact – Bonus Funding for Outstanding GG20 Arbitrum Round ProjectsCartographer SyndicateFarcaster Builder ProgramGIV-Arb Ecosystem Accelerator ProgramOasis Onchain Quick GrantsOxcart Delegation EngineReFi in ArbitrumRWA Innovation Grants (RWAIG)X/Twitter Spaces with M1b Grant ProgramsFor Thank ARB’s Grant-a-palooza X/Twitter space series, we kicked off weekly spaces with the grant programs we selected to generate additional awareness and have in-depth conversations with its program managers to cover the projects they’re looking to fund, the funding mechanisms they’ll be using, and how they plan on making an impact within Arbitrum. We’ve covered 3 grant programs so far and have scheduled others in the following weeks on every Wednesday.Cartographer SyndicateReFi in ArbitrumRWA Innovation Grants (RWAIG)More to come…Representing Thank ARB in other X/Twitter spacesOur members, @DisruptionJoe and @BenWest, have been providing thought leadership in various X/Twitter spaces as guest speakers. They continue to promote Thank ARB and the great work we’ve been doing while having high level conversations about grants and the Arbitrum ecosystem.CCN Round Updates: Karma Gap + more - Hosted by Climate Coordination NetworkDecentralizing Grants - Hosted by Push DAOOasis Onchain Quick Grants: AMA with Thank Arbitrum - Hosted by Oasis OnchainGitcoin Grants 20 (GG20)Thank ARB helped facilitate Gitcoin Grants 20 round that was built on the Arbitrum tech stack, which was helpful to our program’s ability to generate results for the Arbitrum DAO for a few different reasons.Being part of the quarterly grants program differs significantly from simply using Gitcoin’s tools.We observed that 9,095 wallets transacted on Arbitrum for the first time in April or May8,879 (25.40%) of donors in GG20 were new to Arbitrum216 (41.38%) of grantees were new to Arbitrum360 contracts were deployed by these addresses in Q2 2024 - a 47% increase from Q1 2024These big competitive QF rounds attract additional funding directly from individual contributors who are motivated to vote with their wallets.The impact of every dollar spent expanded when it was matched by at least 50%.200k donated to matching pools and the remainder of the initial 1 million coming directly from Gitcoin, with a total of 1 million if you included community rounds run independently at the time of the round.Over 600,000 USDC equivalent to the round overall - more funding for builders in our ecosystem.GG20 successfully met our immediate goals:Allocated 100k across four Open Source Software rounds, which is a key area of focus for ARBDistributed 100k among community rounds selected by the elected Community CouncilBudgeted an additional 100k for incentives based on impact assessments (might give details on how this went and tie to the results of the round being the best in some time)Facilitated 35,473 total addresses transacting on Arbitrum, which included 34,951 addresses contributing over 600,000 USDC-equivalent to 522 grantees. Including matching funds from Gitcoin, the end result was transactions totaling more than 2 million USD on Arbitrum during GG20…Doubled the number of open source projects from the previous rounds which meant a wider range of excellent projects to potentially support and attract into the Arbitrum ecosystem.FirestartersThe Firestarters program aims to address urgent needs and high-impact areas for the Arbitrum DAO by linking problem identification with community-driven resource allocation.  Grant sizes range from $5,000 to $50,000.Our decentralized group of fifty high-context Arbitrum community members have reviewed 29 applications to date and selected the following projects for funding:ProjectAI-generated summary of program descriptionFunded AmountSheFi [Maggie Love]SheFi empowers professional women and non-binary individuals to reinvent their careers in Web3 through an 8-week immersive program and large-scale in-person events, focusing on infrastructure, DeFi, and consumer blockchain use cases. Funding SheFi would enable the creation of content and quests related to the Arbitrum ecosystem, provide scholarships, sponsor community events, and develop a contributor program in collaboration with Arbitrum DAO.ARB 50,000.00Arbimistic Governance Module [Axis Advisory]Review and assess the Arbitrum Core Governor contracts with a focus on OpenZeppelin modules and the integration of the EasyTrack Governor mechanism for compatibility and security. Develop, test, and deploy the EasyTrack Governor, including modifications to the voting logic, proposal state transitions, and hierarchical governance structures, followed by thorough documentation of changes, architecture, and usage guidelinesARB 24,000.00Web3 University Incubator [Farstar]The Web3 University Incubator pilot, called the Summer School, will feature a 2-week intensive in-person program in London followed by 4 weeks of online support, leveraging our extensive experience in top universities globally and strong connections with blockchain societies at Imperial College, UCL, Oxford, and Cambridge. We aim to select 6-8 teams for an August kickoff, anticipate participation from organizations like A16Z, and leverage Farstar’s extensive experience in tech investments and Web3 to deliver a world-class program, which can be replicated in other countries through the newly established Farstar Swarms DAO.ARB 33,333.00Gardens [Gardens DAO]This program will fund Conviction Voting pools using Gardens v2, aimed at specific verticals within the Arbitrum ecosystem to build small, knowledgeable communities. Deliverables include creating a Gardens v2 Community with ARB as the staking token, establishing a Council Safe, publishing a Covenant, and creating 5-10 targeted Conviction Voting pools, with the first pool funded within 2 months and all funds distributed within a year, tracking metrics like TVL, daily active users, and qualitative surveys.ARB 33,333.00Gitcoin Passport [Gitcoin Passport]Gitcoin Passport seeks to use this grant to extend its onchain attestations to Arbitrum, expanding from its current support for OP and Linea, with over 100k wallets attesting to unique humanity. This extension will increase data availability and generate transaction activity on Arbitrum, with deliverables including the deployment of attestations on Arbitrum, schema deployment, and tracking, and integration within Passport, aiming for users to publish onchain attestations and enable new use cases such as devcon ticketing and role-based delegation on Arbitrum.ARB 24,000.00Arbitrum Hub - The Gateway to Seamless Navigation and Exploration in the ArbitrumDAO Ecosystem [BoldPanther]Our project developed a comprehensive Sync Platform for the Arbitrum DAO, featuring key web pages such as the homepage, community hub, grant hub, work-group hub, proposal hub, blog, network activity page, ecosystem page, partners, branding & press, and career page. Implementing a markdown-based system for easy content management and thorough documentation, the five-month phased development resulted in increased user engagement, streamlined processes, improved usability, enhanced transparency, and growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem through better visibility and collaboration.ARB 33,333.00Polity GRADE (Grant Review and Decision Enhancement) Programme [Ethelo Decisions]Polity’s GRADE wizard enhances grant evaluations for Arbitrum DAO managers through a custom upgrade of Ethelo’s Member Area, allowing for easy use of templates, CSV & JSON data uploads, and multi-criteria decision-making tools. Supporting both individual and team use, it enables participatory evaluations for groups from 5 to 10,000+, presenting real-time results and includes a grant evaluation template, a custom evaluation hub, direct data uploads, and comprehensive training and support. Metrics focus on reducing grant evaluation time by 90%, optimizing the value of grants, and enhancing alignment with strategic priorities, with a structured timeline for pilot evaluation, training, and full deployment.ARB 20,000.00TotalARB 217,999.00Closing Thank ARB Season 10Thank ARB Season 10 (Milestone 1b) was focused on 4 main targets: Supporting Gitcoin’s GG20 round that was facilitated on Arbitrum, RFP applications, Firestarter applications, and engaging the wider Arbitrum ecosystem with educational opportunities such as learning more about the DAO, Orbit chains, and Stylus.We saw a 163% increase in contributor number from previous season to this season - 713 contributors to 1,876. Not only did we see a large increase in contributors, they engaged with Thank ARB contributions on a more frequent basis - 713 contributions to 4,693 for a 558% increase in engagement with our platform.We’re continuing to refine our strategy to further engage the community to maximize value creation within Arbitrum with our recently launched Season 11, Thriving Arbitrum Summer.2. Oversight Board & Milestone Delivery TrackingBoard meetingsIn June, we held three Oversight Board meetings. We continued publishing weekly updates on the forum to keep the community in the loop on what was discussed at these board meetings.

This initiative addressed the inherent challenges of building within distributed organizations, where governance ideation and collaboration thrive on deep relationships. However, such relationships are often hard to develop in rapidly growing digital spaces characterized by anonymity, sporadic rhythms of engagement and limited face-to-face interactions.GovHack set out to achieve the following objectives:Accelerate how we work together as a DAO and an ecosystemDeepen human relationships & support systems among DAO contributorsIdentify and take action on cross-collaboration opportunitiesAttract DAO curious bystanders to learn more and get their hands dirtyShip in-depth proposals for long-term engagementApproachTo ensure these objectives were met, Hack Humanity employed various strategies, including building:Arbitrum Ecosystem MapEstablishing the Hackathon Working GroupBuilding an Arbitrum Ecosystem Twitter List of key contributorsEngaged in 10+ Open Community Calls, conducted 10+ 1-1 calls with key DAO contributors to understand the gaps and needs of the DAOParticipant persona development, participant experience design, and track and challenge statement development via community-co-designed Mapathon workshops.Mapathon MiroboardZoom recordings for mapathon:Round 1Round 2These efforts aimed to ensure that the event:was value aligned with the DAO constitutionrelevant and strategically aligned with DAO needs and goalsattracted the right talentcurated good problems to work on, these were represented as Tracks and Challenge Statementsappropriate and effective incentivisation mechanisms to attract the right talent, matched to the right problem, resourced with what they need to innovate1600×895 163 KBTracks and ideal Talent Profiles identifiedCleanShot 2024-04-16 at 23.44.55@2x1920×1074 125 KBThis ambitious set of objectives sought not only to accelerate the pace of innovation and collaboration within the Arbitrum ecosystem but also to establish a model for how distributed organizations can foster deep trust and cooperation, crucial for achieving governance ideation and collaborative success.Deliverables, KPIs and Milestones:Consult on organizational focused calls with the Foundation team prior to GovHackLead mapathon process, public governance calls with delegates and community members to identify potential working groups, hackathon Tracks, Challenge Statements, Contributor Talent profilesOutreach, recruitment, and assess and consulted for advice on participants, built the team of co-facilitators, mentors, judgesDesign incentive mechanics, prizes, submission criteria, judging criteriaDesign and facilitated in-person working groups on Day 1 and Day 2 of GovHackInterviews with delegates and community members during GovHackLead impact report & governance call for the ArbitrumDAO community after the ArbGov Hack event to discuss what was successful, what could be done better, and potential next stepsDesign custom GovHack t-shirts & stickers for participants and crewCleanShot 2024-04-16 at 17.42.47@2x1920×1002 82.1 KBMedia & storytelling: 3 daily recap videos produced, daily tweet threads posted on Arbitrum’s social account, live interviews conducted with key stakeholders and participants, aftermovie, panels, and demo day recordings.Community Showcase Day on Day 3:5 Final Pitches3 Panels16 demo day showcases of existing Arbitrum projectsAchievements and Outcomes1600×900 314 KBExpert Educational TalksAt the Governance Bootcamp Day 1 & 2, two educational talks were hosted by Disruption Joe and Devansh Mehta to give participants more insight into how their proposals fit into the DAO and offer guidance around forum writing and submissions.Principles for Implementing a Pluralist Grants Framework] by Disruption Joedocs.google.comEthDenver Presentation [Final]Principles for Implementing a Pluralist Grants Framework By Disruption Joe Head of Growth @ Thrive Protocol“Writing for the Forum” by Devansh MehtaExpert PitstopOn Day 2, we curated an “Expert Pitstop” team of knowledgeable stakeholders to offer live feedback and consultation as teams prepared their proposals for submission.

Anecdotally we heard multiple times from top delegates that they’d accomplished more in 2 days than in months.""It’s been an interesting few days at GovHack. The DAO has created a backlog of initiatives and ideas that we’d like to explore, over the last 6 months. In 2 days of same-room collaboration, with a bunch of talented and creative minds, we were able to take action and drive change forward. The amount of work that’s been done in this 2-day sprint is way more than I had ever anticipated.-DK, Delegate and FounderDeepen human relationships & support systemsMany people were excited to meet people in person that they’d been working with online for months. Our surveys also indicate that many new connections were formed, which is important as the majority of participants also signaled that they were new to the DAO.764×303 10.8 KB“There are a lot of great people in Arbitrum that you only meet on the other end of a computer screen.In most of web3, we don’t have those personal connections. We don’t have the ability to go out and meet with somebody, we talk to them through platforms and a lot of times those forms of communication are not good for async relationships. So this is bonding. this is the chance to go meet somebody you had a disagreement with and build a human connection, so that the next time when you disagree with somebody or see something differently, you know it’s a human on the other end - and it just makes life so much easier when I can see that I know that person, I have a personal connection with them and they just see things differently than I do.So this is web3 bonding - this is what this is.”-Shawn L.

The poll we ran on Day 1 indicates that over half of participants have been connected to the ecosystem for less than 6 months.808×347 13.5 KB“The same way we focus on iterating and building our technology, we do need to do the same thing on the human capital side of what we’re building and I think this [GovHack] was wonderful. The fact is there were many people who were only newly exposed to Arbitrum, who went and dedicated some time. They now have a sense of how their involvement is going to help move Arbitrum forward.”-CoinFlipCanadaI think the [event] activities are really helping some of the newbies, those who come with less context of the DAO, to understand what could be valuable. Which is often one of the problems - you join a forum and there are a bunch of posts, and you don’t really know where to go. The key to really understanding, to really be able to participate, is the social relationships. We think that DAOs are trustless, but behind that there is this whole social network and unless you are part of that community, you cannot operate it.-Daniel Opsina, Founder of RnDAOShip in-depth proposals for long-term engagement23 proposals were launched during the event, which can be found here on the forum. These proposals are now underway for review and iteration over the coming months.“I think what resonated the most with me [from this event] is the energy and the feeling of being able to do something…that actually we have some power, some ability to move things forward. This has been quite evident in the crowd, that everyone feels that the reason why they spend 2 days working on those proposals is because they really believe they can make it happen. And now we need to make sure that they actually can. So that was awesome - I want more of it.”-Krzysztof Urbański“It’s been quite exciting because it provides an opportunity for people to meet different DAO contributors and delegates and get feedback on proposals that they’ve been thinking about for months, like myself.I think that I received a lot of great feedback that will provide me with an opportunity to refine the proposal that I’ve already submitted so that it can be more successful.”-FeemsEvent OverviewHighlights & Key Data10 Established TracksBetting on BuildersContributor Onboarding, Activation & EngagementGame Development & IncentivesARB Token LiquiditySequencerDAO BD StrategyOrbit Adoption StrategyGrants EcosystemDAO Operational ExcellenceStrategic Big Bets23 teams formed23 proposals submitted (100% submission rate on the forum)5 judgesEmiliano Bonassi: Researcher at Conduit.xyzKrzysztof Urbański: Governance Lead, L2BeatDK: Co-Founder, PremiaRob Benhke: CEO & CoFounder, HalbornCattin: Freelance Designer5 finalists winning a combined total of $15k in prizesOpen Community DayInterviewsKrzysztof Urbański (@kaereste) from L2BeatDistruptionJoe from ThriveProtocol interviewSoby from XAI interviewPanelsPanel 1 - Abitrum Grants EcosystemPanel 2 - Contributor’s DilemmaPanel 3 - DAO Orbit StrategyDemo Day17 projects demo-ed on the Open Community DayHack Humanity worked with Amin Iman, who took the initiative to organize and led the sourcing and coordination of all startups that were featured in our project showcase for Open Community Day.Brahma - https://twitter.com/BrahmaFiSavvy - https://twitter.com/SavvyDeFiChateau - https://twitter.com/Chateau_capitalRnDAO - https://twitter.com/RnDAO__Ourmada - https://twitter.com/Ourmada_xyzFootium - https://twitter.com/FootiumEpoch Protocol - https://twitter.com/0xEpochProtocolClr.fund - https://twitter.com/clrfundPerennial - https://twitter.com/perenniallabsMarginly - https://twitter.com/marginlycomGemach Lend - https://twitter.com/GemachLendWise Lending - https://twitter.com/Wise_LendingOpen Dollar - https://twitter.com/open_dollarContrax - https://twitter.com/Contrax_FinanceCede.store - https://twitter.com/CedeLabsPrimex Finance - https://twitter.com/primex_officialCookbook.dev - https://twitter.com/cookbook_devDemo Day Playlist: Participant ExperienceParticipant demographics and registration dataEach day of the event, attendees were checked-in via the Luma event app.107 attendees checked-in over the 2-day hackathon192 total check-ins over the entire event**actual numbers are somewhat higher as a few attendees were not checked in, and this does not include the Arbitrum Foundation attendance or the Hack Humanity crewBreakdown of attendee demographics from live polls:808×347 13.5 KB807×365 13.4 KB806×552 20.5 KB“It was a delight to see a microcosm of the DAO in real life, with the same energy, creativity, initiative-taking and enthusiasm as on the DAO’s various digital platforms. It also highlighted that anyone can be who they want in the DAO. More importantly, that despite working with trustless technology, human trust cannot be replaced. This human trust is something that GovHack helped develop”.-Raam, Arbitrum Foundation""It’s been an interesting few days at GovHack.

It was one of the rare events where most attendees were engaged and not hanging out in the hallway networking. I have a feeling that this in-person experience is a turning point for the ArbitrumDAO. Excited to see what happens next.Probably the greatest thing to come from this event is evidence that contributors are indeed empowered and when people are actually empowered to do something then they will step up and kick ass. ArbitrumDAO governance is truly alive and it’s going from strength to strength every month.”-Patrick McCorry via Twitter, Arbitrum Foundation“The whole goal of this event was to get more proposals in the DAO and to have people write better proposals. And while we I think succeeded, to be honest it went above my expectations, we need to make sure we use this potential going forward.I think what resonated the most with me is the energy and the feeling of being able to do something…that actually we have some power, some ability to move things forward.

It’s bringing people together, it’s bringing diversity of ideas, diversity of thought, collectively moving these efforts forward. So I actually think GovHack is honestly an awesome idea.The same way we focus on iterating and building our technology, we do need to do the same thing on the human capital side of what we’re building and I think this was wonderful. The fact is there were many people who were only newly exposed to Arbitrum, who went and dedicated some time. They now have a sense of how their involvement is going to help move Arbitrum forward.”CoinFlipCanada“EthDenver was a blast, and the Arbitrum GovHack stole my heart. Exploring the vibrant ecosystem and governance was so enjoyable, and snagging second place was the cherry on top. Huge thanks to the Arbitrum Foundation and Hack Humanity for putting it all together. Excited to ship our proposal in the upcoming weeks, catch you in the forum!”Heather, Finalist from Team 11“I think that there were many opportunities for us to talk to the different judges and delegates to get feedback, and I think the team was really helpful in kind of navigating how we should act and what our schedules are, so I had a pretty positive experience.”I met a lot of online individuals who have legs and are humans so that was really cool, and I think the more that we have in person events the more the community can connect on a more human level.”Feems794×1135 221 KB785×325 52.2 KB1187×1565 312 KBParticipant polls & results:776×393 45.5 KBOver the course of the 3-day event, we ran numerous surveys to collect live feedback from GovHack participants around the connections they were forming on the ground, the learnings they were acquiring around the Arbitrum governance process, and their overall experience of the event.Results were very positive, showing an increase in confidence amongst attendees around creating viable proposals. The majority of participants indicated that they connected with 6-25+ new people in the ecosystem, which correlates well to the fact that many participants in the room were new to the DAO.An NPS score of 67% was established at the end of Day 2 of the Governance Bootcamp:1002×639 46.8 KBSurvey Day 1:761×411 11.5 KBSurvey Day 2:Learnings:1440×810 119 KBNew Connections:1600×1121 67.1 KB772×423 14 KB758×430 17.2 KBQualitative Feedback from Polls:Positive FeedbackEvent Structure: Participants appreciated the event’s structure, timing, facilitation, and the quality of interactions.Networking Opportunities: The focus on discussions and the chance to meet knowledgeable members, builders, and delegates at the Arbitrum DAO were highlighted as positive aspects.Areas for ImprovementTeam Formation: Feedback suggested the need for better matching of participants based on interests and discouraged allowing pre-planned projects to prevent the formation of exclusive groups.Clarity in Instructions: There was confusion about whether participants should stay at one table or move around, affecting networking opportunities. A lack of clarity in assignments with teams struggling to understand their goals and the metrics for success was noted.Information and Preparation: Suggestions were made to provide summaries of the DAO’s governance model to better understand the organizational structures. Participants also expressed a desire for more information about bounties and track details.Recommendations for Future EventsImproving the Environment: A recommendation was made for a quieter event space, possibly with carpeting, to help manage noise levels during main gatherings.Enhancing Team Collaboration: To improve team collaboration and maintain energy levels, clearly written challenge statements by teams and the introduction of mid-day energy-boosting exercises were suggested.Addressing Small Group Challenges: Small groups faced challenges due to overextended community leads, indicating a need for better support structures for smaller teams and better guidance to the community leads.The Hack Humanity media team recorded all presentations, pitches and panels throughout the event and filmed numerous interviews with key participants, delegates and participants.11 dedicated interviews17 demos from the open Community Day3 Panels from the Open Community Day2 Talks with Disruption Joe & Devansh5 Finalist PitchesVia a co-marketing strategy between the ArbitrumDAO and Hack Humanity, the Hack Humanity media team produced daily recap videos and tweet thread copy to support storytelling throughout the event.

The Pitstop panel on Day 2 received very positive feedbackThere was a lack of participation from more Delegates and key protocols in the Mapathon, which constrained the depth and breadth of the tracks and challenge statements that were identified as important for the DAOThere were gaps in IRL participation from key ecosystem stakeholders during the 3 days because GovHack’s scheduling was alongside other key events in Denver, so people were pulled in different directions and unable to give full dedicated time to the participants. This lessened the overall quality of the event as often Community Leads were stretched thin to guide the conversation around their track and support newcomersThe tight preparation timeline of 4 weeks with budget constraints led to challenges in the event organization. There was limited time to engage more key stakeholders in the Mapathon design process, and the Hack Humanity team was spread very thin on organizational tasks such as raising the necessary additional sponsorship to support the increased attendee participation this took up capacity until the very last days before the event, the original budget for the Bootcamp/Community day was for 70/150 people, actual numbers: 109/200+.Hack Humanity absorbed the cost of additional team staffing to accommodate the increased attendance without additional financial support; Hack Humanity also funded out-of-pocket additional media production over the level provided by the Foundation to generate quality media and storytelling to demonstrate the value of full high-end production media to bring the DAO and voices of the DAO to life. In addition, graphics design, t-shirt design, and decor design without a budget in order to demonstrate to Arbitrum what a high-quality production looks like. This needs to be funded properly for subsequent events.The high number of tracks, while promoting inclusion, also split attention more widely and made it difficult to go deeper on key topicsPeople are excited to hack and will even organize themselves and their teams in advance of the event. The total team numbers nearly doubled on Day 2 (from 13 to 23) due to new teams showing up ready to submit proposals. While perhaps a good problem to have, this also presented challenges in catering, equipment, the hackathon structure as submission criteria and judging process needed to be adjusted dynamically to allow for more time to process the larger numbers.The quality of templates and guidance for proposal writing can be improved for participants, especially with the high number of newcomers to the DAO. Teams asked many questions looking for guidance on what constitutes a good proposal.Community voting was well-received but limited to a small pool of voters due to the IRL attendance at that particular time of day on Day 3.With more lead time, we could attract more sponsors to make the event more viable and sustainable, with a larger prize pool to incentivize contributions.Recommendation for Future EventsWith more lead time and budget, a stronger program design and event plan could be established with smoother execution on the ground.There needs to be extreme clarity on submission criteria in advance, with contingency plans in place for sudden growth, to ensure a smooth participant experience in following events.A proposal framework should be prepared for the next event to provide newcomers with better guidance to start out with.A commitment from key delegates and stakeholders to be present for the Mapathon design process to ensure the most important challenges of the DAO are adequately prioritized and represented. Commitment to in-person presence for the full duration of the event would increase the quality significantly, both for the participant’s experience and for the quality of the project outputs. This is one of the core components of the event’s unique value offering.Consider extending the length of the event to provide participants with more time to work on their proposals. Day 1 was consumed with organization around tracks and team formations, and Day 2 proved to be extremely valuable for feedback, iteration and generation of projects. A third and/or 4th day would allow for more comprehensive content and refinement of ideas.If positioning these types of events alongside a major conference, consider choosing a venue within walking distance / very close proximity to allow for higher foot traffic.A cap on the number of demo projects may be advisable, and positioning the pitches earlier in the day when the energy levels of the room are higher. May be interesting to consider incentives for feedback and participation from the audience.Finalist presentations and community voting could be designed for future events to be more inclusive across the wider DAO using experiments via online participation.ConclusionKey achievements of the GovHack include the establishment of meaningful connections among participants, many of whom were new to the DAO space, the identification and fostering of cross-collaboration opportunities, and the empowerment of participants through educational talks and expert feedback sessions. The event’s design increased the quality and quantity of governance proposals, showcasing the practical benefits of in-person collaboration in a digital-first community.Looking forward, the insights gained from this event should guide future initiatives, with a focus on refining event structure, enhancing collaborative opportunities, and ensuring more inclusive participation across the DAO. The success of GovHack serves as a testament to the vibrant potential of the Arbitrum community and sets the stage for further innovation and engagement in the ecosystem. Overall, GovHack was not just a meeting of minds but a pivotal moment that is likely to influence the trajectory of the Arbitrum DAO positively, paving the way for a more connected and dynamic future.C0177.MP4.05_51_46_12.Still0011920×1080 184 KB1600×1200 356 KBThank you from team Hack Humanity.

You can read all about it in this announcement forum post.This initiative aims to draw a wide range of innovative ideas for grant programs and pinpoint forward-thinking program managers to lead them. We are committed to strategic funding that emphasizes plurality, diversity, and meets the immediate needs of the Arbitrum DAO, paving the way for transformative change. There’s approximately 3 million ARB of funding available, which will be distributed across 5-10 programs. We encouraged applicants to consider scalability in their proposals, focusing on achieving a “one dollar in, two dollars out” impact. Applications closed at the end of April, and decisions will be made by a decentralized group of reviewers in mid-May. We have finalized the rubrics for both. The selected programs are expected to roll out from June to September.1200×630 118 KBGitcoin Grants 20 (GG20)The Thank ARB program has enthusiastically embarked on a collaboration with Gitcoin Grants 20 (GG20), marking the first time all core rounds and Allo protocol V2 operate exclusively on Arbitrum. This significant transition has moved all grant contracts and proposals under Arbitrum, streamlining donor contributions and matching fund payouts through this platform for Gitcoin’s 20th quarterly grants round.This initiative has already drawn approximately 35,000 users, many of whom are new to the community, and generated approximately 5 million on-chain transactions. With over $1.5 million in matching funds available, the transaction volume exceeded $2 million equivalent on ARB.The application period for these opportunities opened on April 2nd and closed on April 16th. The donation phase began on April 23rd and will run until May 7th. Thrive Protocol is supercharging the Gitcoin grants round, aiming to create a flywheel effect where strategic rewards and the assessment of impact together generate epic wins for our community. These strategic rewards have been designed for diverse roles within the community, from builders and promoters to curators, to boost involvement and attract top talent to our ecosystem.Key initiatives include the Thank ARB Builders Bonus and substantial rewards for hosting engaging Twitter Spaces. The goal of these efforts is to expand community engagement, increase transaction volumes, and promote wider adoption of the Arbitrum infrastructure. This synergistic approach is enhancing the vitality and reach of the Arbitrum ecosystem during this grant round and beyond.936×526 106 KB2.

We selected 22 applicants to receive a 1,000 ARB planning grant to refine their proposal before making a final selection. We compensated applicants for putting time and resources into designing a good program and hosted two workshops geared towards helping applicants refine their allocation mechanism, metrics, and overall execution plan.As a result, we saw applications that were much improved, geared toward top-level objectives for the Arbitrum Ecosystem as a whole, and oriented toward those ecosystem goals that delegates deem most important for grant programs. We also received overwhelmingly positive feedback that applicants found this process both helpful, educational, and fun! Each application was reviewed by a minimum of 5 of 18 external reviewers sourced from the Arbitrum community. We then selected the eight applicants scoring the highest across four rubrics for funding. The selected programs will run from June to September.We are so excited to be funding the following grant programs Amplifying Impact – Bonus Funding for Outstanding GG20 Arbitrum Round ProjectsCartographer SyndicateFarcaster Builder ProgramGIV-Arb Ecosystem Accelerator ProgramOasis Onchain Quick GrantsOxcart Delegation EngineReFi in ArbitrumRWA Innovation Grants (RWAIG)Gitcoin Grants 20 (GG20)The first program funded by Milestone 1B of our pluralist grants program was Gitcoin Grants Round 20 (GG20), which operated exclusively on Arbitrum for the first time. Additionally, GG20 was supercharged with strategic rewards and impact assessment via Thrive Protocol, offering builders, promoters, curators, and program managers reward opportunities for contributions that boosted community engagement in the round, attracted top talent to the Arbitrum ecosystem, and generally promoted wider adoption of Arbitrum.The donation phase closed on May 7th. GG20 achieved its immediate goals by allocating and distributing 100k across both Open Source Software and community rounds and budgeting an additional 100k for impact-based incentives. It facilitated over 35,000 addresses transacting on Arbitrum, resulting in more than $2 million in total transactions, including matching funds from Gitcoin. Additionally, the number of open-source projects doubled, and Arbitrum was highlighted as the default network for all grant rounds, with Gitcoin committing to continue this partnership through 2024. FirestartersThe second program funded by our pluralist grants program is the Firestarters program. Firestarters aims to address urgent needs and high-impact areas for the Arbitrum DAO by linking problem identification with community-driven resource allocation.  Grant sizes range from $5,000 to $50,000, with projects assessed by a decentralized group of high-context Arbitrum community members. We also published a call to Arbitrum community members to become part of our team of reviewers as we progressively decentralize our pluralistic grants program.The first project selected for funding through the Firestarters program is SheFi, which is led by Maggie Love and empowers professional women and non-binary folks to reinvent their careers in Web3. It’s 8 weeks of immersive instruction, hands-on demos, onchain quests, and peer support aimed at mastering Web3. Together with the Arbitrum Foundation, Thank ARB is sponsoring Season 11 of SheFi, which aims to increase knowledge and adoption of Arbitrum’s Layer 2 solutions, enhance community diversity, and contribute to Arbitrum governance.2.

As part of “Arbitrum & Gitcoin Winter”, the Allo on Arbitrum Hackathon took place on December 8, 2023 through January 10, 2024. This hackathon was co-organized by Plurality Labs (via Arbitrum ","Allo on Arbitrum Hackathon RecapAlso see: Allo / Arbitrum Hackaton Hosted by BuidlBox, Allo & Arbitrum - 👋 News and Community - Gitcoin GovernanceIntroduction:Hackathon Dates: Dec 8, 2023 → Jan 10, 2024Duration: 4 weeksJudging Period: Jan 10 → Jan 20, 2024Winner Announcement: Jan 25, 2024Overview:As part of “Arbitrum & Gitcoin Winter”, the Allo on Arbitrum Hackathon took place on December 8, 2023 through January 10, 2024. This hackathon was co-organized by Plurality Labs (via Arbitrum DAO) + Allo Protocol, and hosted on the buidlbox platform.The goal of the hackathon is to empower builders to build the future allocation mechanisms, UIs, the next data structures and tools that can propel the grant funding initiatives in the Arbitrum ecosystem forward.Organized by:Allo ProtocolPlurality LabsPowered by buidlbox.iobuidlbox played a key role in the support of the Allo on Arbitrum Hackathon. Serving as the hosting platform, we ensured seamless operations, collaborated with organizers, and actively engaged the builder community throughout the course of the hackathon. Our comprehensive support included marketing support, workshop facilitation, livestream hosting, Discord assistance, and growth engagement, emphasizing our commitment to empowering builders within the Allo Protocol and Arbitrum community.Participation Metrics:Number of Participants: 303Projects Started: 102Submission Count (Across 3 challenges): 86Unique Projects Submitted: 46View all projects here.Highlights:1.

Workshops/Events:On Dec 20, the Allo Protocol team hosted a workshop (via Discord livestream) titled “Building with the Allo SDK”, led by Jaxcoder. An additional office hours session was conducted on Jan 10, just before the submission deadline, to address any outstanding questions by builders.4. Team Formation:Team formation took place through a dedicated #team-formation channel on the buidlbox Discord for the hackathon. The breakdown of participants was as follows:Teams of 2 or more: 22%Solo builders: 78%5. Challenges Faced:GPT Summary of Jaxcoder’s ‘Allo / Arbitrum Hackathon’ Retro (via Gitcoin Forum):New developers faced technical challenges due to the learning curve.Many teams smoothly navigated challenges by demonstrating adeptness with Allo’s documentation and setup process.Allo’s recognition as an advanced protocol acknowledges potential hurdles for beginners.Participants’ experiences reflect an impressive learning journey, emphasizing commitment and growth during the hackathon.Judging and Winner Selection:Following the project submission deadline, judging took place between January 11-20, 2024. A total of 9 judges evaluated all 46 projects based on the following criteria:Design and UX: Is it visually appealing and easy to use?Originality: Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way?Technical Accomplishment: Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete? Does the project interact with Allo Protocol under-the-hood?Potential Utility: Does the project fill a need that grant program managers have? Does it have the potential to be used by grant program managers?Each project was individually scored on a scale from 1-10 in each category. Average scores were taken into consideration when selecting challenge winners.The judging and winner selection process involved two key phases:1) Judging Period:The judging process spanned from January 11-20, during which judges individually assessed a total of 86 submissions and recorded their scores on the buidlbox platform.A panel of 9 judges, including representatives from Plurality Labs/Arbitrum DAO and Allo Protocol, conducted independent evaluations for all three challenges based on the following criteria:Design and UX: Is it visually appealing and easy to use?Originality: Does it have unique and novel features or combine features of other products or services in a unique and novel way?Technical Accomplishment: Is the code elegant, clean, and technically interesting? Is the project complete? Does the project interact with Allo Protocol under-the-hood?Potential Utility: Does the project fill a need that grant program managers have? Does it have the potential to be used by grant program managers?Each project was individually scored on a scale from 1-10 in each category. Average scores were taken into consideration when selecting challenge winners.2) Final Winner Selection:Following the judging period, the lead hackathon organizers (Plurality Labs and Allo Protocol) conducted a thorough review of project evaluations.On January 22, during an internal meeting, the lead hackathon organizers made the final decisions on the winners.While judging scores played a significant role in determining challenge finalists, it’s crucial to note that they were not the sole factors in the winner selection process.Winners were ultimately chosen by the lead hackathon organizers, guided by projects that demonstrated strong potential, compelling use cases, innovation, and originality.Results and Awards:Winning Projects:Best Novel Funding Distribution ToolFirst: Conviction Voting App“A fun, simple app for allocating funds using Conviction Voting.

It democratizes real estate investment by enabling transparent and efficient fund management for development projects.”Feedback and Improvement:Throughout the hackathon, the builders expressed overall positive feedback with the hackathon organizers and buidlbox. Upon the winner announcement, some builders raised concerns about the judges’ objectivity and the winner selection process. Allo Protocol and Plurality Labs promptly responded, providing constructive feedback on the projects and clarifying the context behind their final decisions.In response to the concerns, buidlbox issued a follow-up statement on Discord to offer deeper insights into the judging process and winner selection. Initially, builders were frustrated, believing that judging scores alone determined the winners. The statement from buidlbox clarified the two phases involved in judging and winner selection (see “Judging and Winner Selection”), aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding for participants.Moving forward, buidlbox is committed to transparently collaborating with future hackathon sponsors and organizers to prevent any future miscommunications. While the judging and winner selection process is determined by the organizers, we are committed to implementing process and feature improvements to ensure participants have a clear understanding of the evaluation process in every hackathon.Other Areas of Improvement:GPT Summary of ‘Allo / Arbitrum Hackathon’ Retro (via Gitcoin Forum) by Jaxcoder:Developer Experience Setbacks:Limited availability of the Allo team during the December holiday period.Future planning should include consideration of global holidays to avoid scheduling conflicts during hackathons.Resource Enhancement Suggestions:Expand video content showcasing Allo’s functionalities.Improve general documentation, with comprehensive SDK documentation and practical examples.Increase the number of video tutorials for better user support.Conclusion:Reflecting on the Allo on Arbitrum Hackathon, which took place from December 8, 2023, to January 10, 2024, it is evident that the 303 participants embarked on a dynamic four-week journey marked by creativity and commitment. The hackathon witnessed 86 unique project submissions across three challenges, showcasing a diverse array of innovative solutions that made a lasting impression on the Allo Protocol and Plurality Labs teams.The hackathon’s activities, including Twitter/X Spaces, workshops, and other livestream events, fostered a collaborative and dynamic atmosphere, contributing to a positive hackathon experience for builders.The winning projects, such as the Conviction Voting App, Alloliance, and AGDM, showcased remarkable innovation and creativity within the community. As a result of the quality of project submissions in this hackathon, Allo Protocol is excited for future collaborations with the talented builders, fostering more collaboration and growth within the Allo Protocol and Arbitrum communities.Closing Thoughts:Warm congratulations to the winning projects, and a heartfelt thank you to all the participants who dedicated their time and effort to submit projects. Our sincere appreciation extends to every participant, sponsor, organizer, and judges who played a crucial role in the success of this event. At buidlbox, our commitment to continuous improvement remains steadfast. Looking ahead, we are excited to build on this momentum, fostering even closer collaborations with hackathon organizers, co-sponsors, and builders, and creating more enriching experiences in future hackathons. The future holds exciting possibilities, and buidlbox is thrilled to continue empowering builders and advancing innovation within the Allo Protocol and Arbitrum community. Thank you all for being an integral part of this incredible journey!"

It facilitates a streamlined approach for general users to engage with different initiatives in ArbitrumDAO and offers detailed insights into upcoming events. The hub is designed to boost user engagement and draw in new users using targeted strategies and by consistently updating information to improve understanding of ArbitrumDAO. Essentially, ArbitrumHub seeks to foster an informed, engaged community by providing all stakeholders, from developers to investors, with immediate access to vital information.For more details on arbitrumhub: refer to this forum postWebsite: Arbitrum HubTwitter: Arbitrum HubTL;DRArbitrumHub is a platform serving the ArbitrumDAO community by providing seamless access to information, real-time updates, event coordination, and collaboration opportunities. The RFC is seeking feedback from the community to draft a final proposal for the DAO to secure relevant support for maintaining and expanding ArbitrumHub according to the DAO’s needs.The Need for ArbitrumHub and Its UsesArbitrumHub addresses the need for a coherent resource within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem grows, the amount of information and the number of initiative increases, making it challenging for community members to stay informed and connected. ArbitrumHub simplifies this by gathering all essential information and resources in one place. Unlike forums, which are often used for general discussions, ArbitrumHub provides structured and reliable information.Uses of ArbitrumHub include:Real-Time Updates: Provides the latest news and developments within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring that all community members are up to date.Community Interaction Updates: Updates the entire community about all kinds of upcoming meets and interactions, so members don’t miss out on anything.Event Coordination: Details upcoming events, workshops, making it easy for users to find and participate in community activities.Support and Resources: Offers a hub for details on all initiatives in ArbitrumDAO, as well as a support system for community members seeking assistance with platform-related queries.Enhanced Visibility: Utilizes targeted marketing strategies like social media and newsletters to increase engagement and bring more visibility to community initiatives.Comprehensive Resource Integration: Aggregates resources such as developer tools, grant information, incentive programs, and other initiatives to support various community segments effectively.Key Features of ArbitrumHub and New IdeasStructured Flow of Information: Organizes content logically to ensure users can easily follow and understand updates and information.Introduction of New Pages: Adds new sections to the hub, such as event calendars, subchain overviews, on-chain activities, to cater to diverse interests within the community.Comprehensive Listings and Explanations: Describes every feature, tool, and resource available on the platform thoroughly to ensure users can make the most of the hub.Streamlining Information: Pulls data from various sources into a unified format, making it more accessible and easier to navigate.MultiSig Tracking: Includes features to track and report on every transaction and expenditure from the treasury, promoting financial transparency.Collaboration with Workgroups: Provides dedicated spaces for different community groups to collaborate, share resources, and work together on projects.Regular Updates: The hub will be continuously updated to reflect the latest developments and changes within the Arbitrum ecosystem.Invite-Only CMS: Access to manage and publish content will be controlled through an invite-only content management system, ensuring quality and security.Dedicated Event Pages: Facilitates building comprehensive event pages for all events to explain all the details and how to be a part of it.Meeting and Discussion: The ArbitrumHub team will continuously be in touch with all stakeholders to ensure the hub can provide access to all information to everyone, including outsiders, to streamline understanding of ArbitrumDAO.Recent Successes and Ongoing InitiativesArbitrumHub is currently being used by the foundation to detail different grant programs and incentives. It is in the process of becoming a central hub for all related activities, gathering feedback from users to enhance functionality. The platform also has a dedicated Twitter profile and has received endorsements from several prominent community members.Why Support for Expansion Is Needed?Keeping ArbitrumHub up and running is a big task that requires a lot of resources. Our operations are growing, and we need ongoing funding to keep everything moving smoothly. Supporting our expansion is crucial for the DAO because it helps make the understanding of ArbitrumDAO even better and more useful. We’ve put a lot of work and research into building ArbitrumHub from the ground up. Now, as we keep improving and evolving based on what our community tells us, DAO support can make a huge difference in keeping this essential resource strong and effective.We would like to engage in a comprehensive discussion with the entire community to gather your feedback and suggestions. Your insights are invaluable as we aim to enhance and expand ArbitrumHub and propose a final proposal to DAO. Please share your thoughts and feel free to drop any suggestions to improve this proposal.Thank You"

And ideally, making this discovery simple and accessible for users.In a span of a couple months, there will be 100+ protocols that will distribute upwards of $60-80 million of ARB in incentives. Throughout the Arbitrum ecosystem, there will be an abundance of new engagement opportunities, but how do we ensure the right users can effectively discover what is happening?With STIP, little to no adjacent marketing or communication was administered to supplement the incentive rollout, let alone a central base for users to know where incentives are being offered and how to earn them. Compared to other ecosystems, this is a major gap in Arbitrum’s overall execution strategy and we believe there needs to be action taken to ensure successful engagement of the programs.Potential SolutionsAt bare minimum, there needs to be some sort of incentive hub, a home base of sorts (ex. Base’s Onchain Summer), for users to discover the protocols offering incentives.Some potential ideas on what this could look like:A. Page on the Arbitrum Foundation websiteEx. Something like the Portal or an additional section on the portalProsHigh visibilityIdeal for branding cohesion + ecosystem discoverySimple and intuitive for end userCan serve as a POC for long term programsConsIs this feasible given the short timeline?Does the Foundation have the available resources?B. custom, community created Incentives Program websiteProsIncreased customizationManaged directly by contributors in the Arbitrum DAOCan also serve as a POC for long term programsConsUnknown cost and timelineHigher execution risk given tight timelinePotentially low visibility if not distributed correctly across content channelsC. Dedicated incentive program Notion hubProsManaged directly by contributors in the Arbitrum DAOLower execution riskConsLimited customization and visibilityNot suited as a long-term solutionThese are just a couple of options pulled together from an initial brainstorm. Implementation could be one of these or a combination of other explored/unexplored options.Next StepsGiven the start of incentive distribution (mid-May) is less than a month out, we are presenting this RFC with urgency, hoping to receive ample feedback by early next week.Open Call:Additionally, we will be hosting an open community call tomorrow, April 19th, at 5PM UTC, to discuss potential ideas around enhancing discoverability and distribution of the incentive programs in addition to the other marketing needs of funded projects in STIP.b & LTIPPCan’t make the call?

This verification process can help with protecting the ecosystems treasury assets by checking that the funding is being used as intended.Contribution efforts could be grouped together by using a milestone approach or by using time intervals such as monthly. Alternatively contribution efforts could also be recorded by each individual in monthly time intervals.After looking at the problems and opportunities for making group based contribution logs as well as individual contribution logs, we identified that individual contribution logs were the most promising approach worth considering. As well as verifying contribution efforts the individual contribution log approach also had a number of other use cases that could be highly valuable for contributors and Web3 ecosystems.individual-monthly-contribution-logs1530×1150 150 KBAdvantages of individual contribution logsImproved contribution verification - It is more difficult to hide poor contribution performance if efforts are recorded individually and at the end of every month. Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.Improved decision making - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.Retaining top performers - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.Higher self awareness & accountability - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.Empowers individual contributors - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.Removed intermediaries - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.Flexible information usage - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.Opportunities for individual contribution logsOpen source contribution data - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.Self sovereign identity adoption - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.Trust based networks - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share.ResourcesRead our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:Contribution verificationContribution verification approachesExperimentation in ArbitrumIndividual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.Further investigationThese is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts. We’re especially interested in improving the exposure and presentation of code contributions, this is an area of high relevance to our open source contributor proposal that has been recently shared.Community discussionShare any feedback and thoughts you have around the topic of contribution verification and the different approaches we’ve explored in our analysis. Eager to hear any different perspectives or other approaches and analysis we might be missing that could improve our own understanding and improve our analysis further!"

How do we define success of a grant program in a way that is aligned with the needs of the ecosystem overall?On Tuesday the 23rd, Thank ARB hosted a session to align on these goals.There are three phases to this project. This is a summary of the first phase.Using the results of the session while we further converge in understandingConducting community surveys to involve more voicesFinalizing priorities with a Snapshot voteOverview of the SessionAfter a quick icebreaker sharing the worst clothing style choices of our lives, we started to work on the following agenda:1600×1045 332 KBOops… I mean the agenda:1375×1326 139 KBWe brainstormed North Star Metrics, objected to some, honed in on others. In the end, we came up with the following North Star Metrics (which we call Objectives) in no particular order.Increase Daily Active Users (DAU)Increase Total Volume Locked (TVL)Increase Net Bridge InflowsIncrease Number of Verticals Arbtrum Leads in Market ShareIncrease Number of Protocols Actively Building on ArbitrumIncrease Number of People Buying ARB to Use in GovernanceWe then brainstormed and heatmapped support for which levers have the best opportunity to affect these objectives. We called these goals.The top suggestions include:Kickstart new verticalsIncentivize dapps for retentionAttract new protocols willing to mint natively with lockups on ArbitrumDesign and implement staking & utility use cases for ARBConvince RWAs to launch nativelyMarket to institutional investorsTargeted marketing campaigns to educate about orbit & stylusConduct token swaps with leading protocolsIncentivize redelegation by tokenholdersHighly targeted marketingStart a DAO DevRel teamProvide DAO support servicesGain unquestionable lead in defi, gaming, and RWAsThese goal suggestions were then broken down into strategies and measures. We relate this to a grant program in that most won’t be able to directly affect an objective like increasing the TVL. However, we can select them based on their alignment to ecosystem needs.If you’re thinking “Holy snozberries!!! Those North Star Metrics must have been drafted by some type of nincompoop”, don’t worry. This is only the first phase.Next StepsWe will be launching a survey to key delegates & contributors to suggest anything missing. During this time, we will use what we have to guide our grant program coaching efforts.The results of the survey will be used to create a Snapshot vote allowing the full DAO to participate in ranking the Goals.Then, each grant program will need to show which ecosystem goals they are directly aiming to impact. They will articulate the strategy being used and the measure of their success.In the end, we will end up with grant programs having legitimate measures to understand their success or failure. It is important that an experimental program can fail at the pilot stage, but the incentive is normally to claim everything as a success. This ratified alignment and process requirement to improve communication at all levels of the program will be critical.Here are some more pictures of our OGSMs which were started during the final breakout session.

This report was produced under a grant and in collaboration with Plurality Labs.The report offers:conceptual frameworksexample practicespractical next stepsTo constitute a program for Arbitrum DAO targeting funding for ongoing activities that pursue long-term goals. The purpose of the Expert Service Provider Network is to ensure Arbitrum DAO has access to expert services that are:accountablefiscally responsiblecompatible with the marketAnd that adequately aligns incentives - including accountability mechanisms - between Arbitrum DAO and potential expert service providers.You can find the Executive Summary below. You can find the full report via this link: https://block.science/images/ArbitrumExpertServiceProviderNetworkProgramDevelopment.pdfExecutive SummaryArbitrum DAO is not a single party, but a complex polity constituted by an array of technical infrastructures, organizations, processes, cultural norms, and a diverse group of people. Action in the context of Arbitrum can emanate from many different loci of coordination. This report addresses AribitrumDAO as the main forum for public engagement in governance; it provides background research and guidance for the development of an Expert Service Provider Network. The purpose of an Expert Service Provider Network is to ensure that Arbitrum DAO has access to expert services in a manner that is accountable to the public, fiscally responsible, and compatible with the market for those services.Arbitrum DAO funds programs, such as the one which sponsored this work, via its existing governance processes that are run by third-party entities. Those programs, in turn, pursue their specific mandates accountable to the Arbitrum DAO via various reporting requirements and norms. The Expert Service Provider Network would constitute a new program targeting funding for on-going activities pursuing long-term goals, and requiring significant domain expertise to be performed or evaluated. Previous proposals to the Arbitrum DAO have suggested expert activities including, but not limited to, quantitative finance modeling, economic policy analysis and recommendations, code audits, and cybersecurity related services. While Arbitrum would benefit from these services, there is not currently a program in place that adequately aligns incentives (including accountability mechanisms) between Arbitrum DAO and the potential expert service providers.Given the scale of funding required to procure expert services on an ongoing basis, a program specifically designed to serve this purpose is recommended. Furthermore, such a program should be co-developed with input from the public and from domain experts in order to ensure legitimacy of large expenditures. Co-development of the program can be onerous as it requires all participants to align on the purpose of the program, the specific stakeholders it serves, and the environmental factors influencing its architecture, as well as a design framework and evaluation heuristics for governance structures. This report aims to lower that burden by providing conceptual frameworks, example practices, and practical next steps for the co-development of an Expert Service Provider Network program.The recommended program co-development process should begin with education and facilitated discussions funded under an existing program’s mandate. An iterative process involving both mechanism design experts and members of the public will conclude with a program architecture suitable for consideration by the Arbitrum DAO. The program development phase is complete when the Arbitrum DAO funds the Expert Service Provider Network program. Following funding, the operationalization phase begins with a series of domain specific education and facilitated discussions, mirroring the early process — but this time the mandates for the specific expert functions, rather than the Expert Service Provider Network, needs to be defined. In the first cycle of expert service provider funding many of the properties specified in the program architecture will have their implementation details determined. The operationalization phase is complete when the first cycle has concluded and service provider evaluation has been incorporated into the second cycle service provider selection process.The BlockScience team will join the Incentives Working Group call on April 2, the Open Governance call on April 3, and the Procurement Committee (ADPC) call April 18 to present the findings, answer any questions, and engage in discussion around next steps. You can find these calls on the Arbitrum DAO Governance community calendar."

While selecting only one is something that has a merit, selecting all translated in non legal votesratification of decisions of the council for LTIPP votes on single protocols: we were constraints in putting up 77 proposals, and delegates have to vote on 77 different snapshots. We could have had, instead, put up for example 5 proposals with 16 options, one for each protocol, saying “yes/no/abstain”, so that loading the proposals would have been faster, and voting on proposals, while requiring still time for scrutiny, would have been effectively faster.These are the 2 main examples that came to my mind, involvingimposing a minimum/maximum amount of selections in a multi choices snapshotcreate batch voting with no internal weights.Idea is to discuss here if DAO feels the above is useful, throw in the forum some more potential ideas, contact snapshot, define a cost, write a formal proposal, and then vote and execute. One thing that also has to be discussed is how this would be effectively execute, it doesn’t make sense to create a new multisig for this, so maybe we could leverage infrastructure and committee we have now already.Just to give some context: i have already taken contact with snapshot to understand if the above was possible, and the terms. We are talking accordingly to some initial findings about developments that should take a few weeks in the order of potentially 10-15k usd each. Please don’t take the numbers above as any hard promise on their side, nor anything. This is me just coming forward to have an estimate of the resources (time + capital) that we would need to move it forward on.If the DAO also finds the above just too much of a burden for the relative low amount, we could likely pursue other roads like questbook to make it done. But again, I am interested in gathering some opinions on the value, after chatting with a few delegates that were positive on it.You friendly arbitrum cow."

Despite the size and activity level of the Arbitrum ecosystem, the DAO itself has a small number of active participants. As of Feb 9, the last 10 Arbitrum Snapshot proposals saw an average 27,598 wallets participate. This is in light of the 921,457 ARB holders (895,477 on L2, 25,980 on L1). This results in an average participation rate <3%. Retail is not voting.This strikes us as a problem. Granted, this is a problem insofar as we accept the following:Axiom: A democratic system is more robust the more opinions are heard.We can motivate this assumption by recognizing that while 99% of new ideas might fail, a crucial competitive edge is likely to come from that 1%. Over 97% of ARB holders are currently sidelined, likely due to the unfortunately rational conclusion that their small retail holdings won’t move the needle in a governance vote and aren’t worth the hassle. But it’s also likely true that that 1% of winning ideas is currently sitting idle in the head of a member of that long tail distribution of retail ARB holders.tl;dr: Our suggestion is that we brainstorm more ways to increase the variance of idea generation in the Arbitrum DAO, to increase voter participation. Let a 1000 blossoms bloom.Constraining the solution spaceWhenever the topic of grants comes up, it’s important to remain grounded.@SeriousPeople underscored this in their Forum post on KPIs. They argued (with broad community support) that we ought to pay closer attention to how Arbitrum Grants benefit the ecosystem. Some formulae were thrown around before @danielo wisely pointed out, with the support of others including @DisruptionJoe, the danger of being wed to measurables.The space of possible beneficial projects to the ecosystem is significantly larger than the space of measurable beneficial projects. Not everything can be reduced to a KPI, and KPIs are often gameable. In short, “not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”Does this mean we throw caution to the wind? Of course not. Thankfully, when considering boosting retail participation, there is a no-cost way of doing so: delegation, not grants.Without having to emit any ARB tokens, the DAO can reward active retail participants with governance authority. One advantage to this approach is that it attracts governance-interested folks, not capital-chasing mercenaries as can be the case with outright grants.Delegation is already a common solution for getting knowledgeable parties to vote with meaningful authority in the ecosystem. But we view delegates as just one part of the three major stakeholders (the other two being team/investors and retail). Of these three pillars, all are well represented except retail, so to that end we want to open up a conversation about how we can leverage delegation in novel ways to bring more retail to the table.We took a stab at some initial ideas, but would love to brainstorm up some more ideas worth pursuing. Some initial ideas include:Retroactive delegation en masse: finding the most active, but smallest voters on the DAO and rewarding them with more authority. To make a dent on participation rates we would have to agree to some hurdle rates (number of votes taken, earliest vote, etc). Uniswap recently did something similar, albeit on a much smaller scale than we envisionDelegating to a publicly accessible governance pool: delegating to a sub-DAO where retail can freely or easily join to vote with an increase voice than they otherwise would be able to (disclaimer: this is a solution we’re actively working on)ConclusionIt’s in Arbitrum’s best interest to bring more retail voices to the table. The best way to do that is by increasing the scope of delegation to active participants. Some preliminary ideas include retroactive delegation en masse, and delegation to a sub-DAO. Delegation, not grants, provide an easy, no-cost solution to the problem of low voter turnout. But this is just our initial thoughts. We’re looking forward to hearing from the rest of the community about other interesting ways to leverage delegation as a means of bringing more retail voices to the table thereby empowering hitherto now neglected 3rd pillar of DAO governance."

This suggested funding process could become a highly effective and scalable approach for Web3 ecosystems to more consistently generate impact.The opportunity to experiment with a contributor funding approach is better highlighted by understanding some of the problems that exist with idea based funding:For contributors, the proposal submission process can require a large amount of effort and time upfront for contributors to participate and then also handle the ongoing burden of proposal writing and budgeting complexities to get involved in an ecosystem. The structure and incentives of this funding process result in a reduced amount of contribution flexibility and income stability that can deter contributors from participating or limit their ability to easily generate high impact.For voters, it is often highly complex to compare and select ideas effectively. Many voters lack the sufficient context, skills and experience required to be well informed and effectively participate in these decisions. The selection process can be highly time consuming and complex for the voters. Voters can rarely express their exact preferences with their voting decisions and also do not have enough accountability or incentives to be expected to spend a meaningful amount of time on voting to make more optimal and well informed decisions.For Web3 ecosystems, ideas are often treated as ephemeral yes or no funding decisions rather than being a collaborative process that looks to discuss and explore different solution approaches. In larger funding processes it can also become easier for innovative ideas to be ignored due to being less well understood or known. The allocation of assets can also be more inefficient in situations where the allocated funds are not actively being used to generate contribution outcomes, this can increase the percentage of deadweight assets that are not being fully utilised at a given point in time.To understand these problems in more detail you can review our analysis on the current funding landscape - Current funding landscape | ContributorsThe good news is that most of these problems can be either greatly reduced or fully resolved! An open source contributor funding process can help with resolving these problems and also could become a highly reliable and effective process for maintaining and improving Web3 ecosystems over the long term.web3-open-source-contributor-funding2020×1070 238 KBOur proposal outlines the suggestion of experimenting with directly funding a small number of open source developers that would help with developing any open source initiatives - this could include improving any existing pieces of software used in the ecosystem or creating entirely new tools and libraries.The advantages and long term opportunities for adopting a contributor funding approach are numerous. We’ve covered the advantages and opportunities of this suggested funding process in more detail in our proposal - Open source contributor funding | ContributorsYou can alternatively watch our videos that cover the same content from our proposal:https://youtu.be/ZWo9qNm3mvs - Current Web3 funding landscapehttps://youtu.be/f3fP2bjf6rY - Tech company comparison with Web3https://youtu.be/mQHqwHIDKMo - Open source contributor fundingThe background analysis that helps to support this proposal can be found here - https://disbursement.treasuries.coExperimentation in ArbitrumThe Arbitrum ecosystem already provides a number of idea based funding processes which can be found on their grants page. These funding processes are great for people that already have an idea to execute but does not help with situations where developers are keen to join the ecosystem but do not have an idea to execute at the moment.Experimenting with an open source contributor funding process could simply mean adding in an extra form process to enable software developers to indicate their interest in contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem as a contributor. These individuals could then help with existing open source solutions being built or new ones that the Arbitrum Foundation suggest to them.The immediate opportunity with experimenting with a contributor focused funding approach would be that it would make it easier for software developers to indicate their interest in working in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Arbitrum Foundation could then identify if there are any promising candidates that could be suitable for contributing towards any relevant initiative in the ecosystem. Contributor funding proposals could end up bringing in impactful talent that otherwise might not have got involved due to the more time consuming upfront idea proposal process. The idea process can make it more difficult for these individuals to just express their interest in working in the ecosystem. A contributor focussed process could provide a more collaborative path for identifying promising talent and matching them with ongoing work that could create impact in the ecosystem.Experiment facilitationIf any ecosystem was interested in experimenting with this suggested funding process but doesn’t want to handle the process fully themselves I am eager to collaborate with them and help wherever I can with setting up and running any of these experiments that are focussed on contributor funding.In either event, contributor funding experiments across many ecosystems could be highly beneficial for the wider industry. The outcomes from these experiments can be analysed to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of this suggested approach against the widely adopted idea based funding approach that we see being more widely used across Web3 ecosystems today. Analysing and documenting these experiment outcomes is something that we intend to work on at the Web3 Association!Community discussionGeneral thoughts & feedbackThere’s likely going to be many opportunities and problems that could be better explored and addressed.

The receiving address for the 6M ARB will be a Foundation-controlled multi-sig SAFE address","Onchain Proposals 1. Entropy Advisors: Exclusively Working With Arbitrum DAO  (voting ends on Friday, Aug 23)Entropy Advisors is requesting 6M ARB to work exclusively with the ArbitrumDAO for one year. This consists of US$2.47M in ARB for an operating budget with a ~10% margin/contingency, and a potential bonus of 1.5M ARB maximum which the DAO can decide to distribute near the end of the 1 year mark.The receiving address for the 6M ARB will be a Foundation-controlled multi-sig SAFE address. Any excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.Entropy Advisors aim to be a Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS) broker for the the DAO, and serve as a liaison between key stakeholders in the ArbitrumDAO and ecosystem. This enables the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.Since inception 5 months ago, Entropy has led key discussions and proposals like GovHack Brussels, adjusting the minimum base fee, the multi-sig support (MSS) service for the DAO , and improving predictability for DAO ops.2. Funds to bootstrap the first BoLD validator (voting starts on Thur, Aug 22)The Arbitrum Foundation is requesting for 5,134 ETH from the L2 Treasury Timelock (ETH treasury) to run a BoLD validator and fulfill the role of being the first honest and active proposer. This proposal is contingent on the proposal <AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD> being approved by the ArbitrumDAO down the line, and all funds will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days of the BOLD proposal being hypothetically rejected.If this proposal passes, the ETH received will be split into 2 multi-sigs -The first multi-sig (Multi-Sig A) will receive a total of 4,234 ETH. 3,600 ETH will be used to run the first BOLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One, and 634 ETH (555 + 79) budget to counter one BOLD challengeThe second multi-sig (Multi-Sig B) will receive 900 ETH, where 500 ETH as service fees for active BOLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.The ArbitrumDAO reserves the right to revoke the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and return the all funds back to the treasury.3. ARB Staking: Unlock ARB Utility and Align Governance  (voting starts on Thur, Aug 22)Tally is proposing to improve the governance and security of the Arbitrum protocol by implementing ARB staking, without yet turning on fee distribution to stakers. ARB staking allows for:the voting power of staked ARB tokens to be delegated to active delegates (determined by Karma score, which is a combination of delegate’s Snapshot voting stats, onchain voting stats and their forum activity), andthe creation of a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification.This proposal includes $200k in ARB of funding to cover the costs of:developing staking smart contracts,integration of ARB into Tally and of Karma into ARB staking,audit costs for staking smart contracts, andfunding of a working group to research on staking rewards and delegation designs.Snapshots⚡️1. Should the DAO Create COI & Self Voting Policies? (voting ends on Thur, Aug 22)This proposal aims to restart the conversation around the creation of self-voting and conflict of interests policies, and outlines various options, ranging from maintaining the status quo to enforcing strict self-voting policies.Having COI and Self Voting policies ensures that every participant in Arbitrum governance is operating under the same set of expectations, and disclosure requirements brings about greater transparency which incentivizes participants to act in an ethical manner.This temperature check uses approval voting, where each delegate can select any number of choices, each selected choice will receive equal voting power. Voting options include including a disclosure policy, and/or a responsible voting policy, and/or a strict self-voting policy, or maintaining the status quo.2. Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum (voting ends on Thur, Aug 22)Karpatkey and Aera are proposing the creation of the Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group (ASTMG). The ASTMG would allocate 250M ARB to be managed by karpatkey, with the goal of ensuring effective treasury management.The program deliverables include yield optimization, DAO-owned liquidity, treasury swaps, as well as treasury diversification.All funds will be managed using the non-custodial tooling of Zodiac Modules and Aera Vaults. This tooling permits the DAO to retain oversight and ownership of the funds at all times while only allowing specific strategies to be employed by the ASTMG.The ASTMG proposes a 1% management fee on the AUM.3. An (EIP-4824 powered) daoURI for the Arbitrum DAO (voting ends on Thur, Aug 22)DAOstar is proposing that the DAO takes control of its data by publishing a daoURI onchain. The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain.Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.4. ArbitrumDAO Off-site - mere temp check, (voting ends on Thur, Aug 22)Danielo is proposing to use this snapshot as a poll to gauge whether top delegates are interested in shaping an ArbitrumDAO offsite.A vote in favour of this proposal does NOT mean an offsite should be executed. A vote in favour will NOT result in a Tally proposal being the next step. A vote in favour only means an offsite should be EXPLORED through conversations with top delegates and key stakeholders.5. Proposal to Temporary Extend Delegate Incentive System (voting ends on Thur, Aug 22)SEEDGov is proposing to  temporarily extend the current Delegate Incentive System for up to 2 months. The current program ends on August 31.While a new and improved version of the Delegate Incentives Program is still being worked on, this proposed extension aims to continue to engage delegates.There is no additional funding request for this extension - funds will come from the Delegate Incentive System Multisig which still has sufficient funds to run the program for 2 months.6. Should the DAO Default to using Shielded Voting for Snapshot Votes? (voting ends on Thur, Aug 22)Entropy Advisors is proposing to kickstart a conversation around the adoption of Shutter’s shielded voting as a default for Snapshot temperature checks. This encrypts votes during the voting period and decrypts them only after the vote closes, mitigating bandwagon effects, voter apathy, and last-minute strategic voting.Shutter’s shielded voting allows ArbitrumDAO to remain consistent with practice in liberal democracies that votes taken by elected officials (delegates in this case) are publicized so that citizens can judge voting records.There will be 4 Voting Choices: For all Snapshot Votes /  For Elections Only / Against / Abstain.There is no cost to the DAO as shielded voting is already available to all DAOs on Snapshot."

Entropy Advisors: Exclusively Working With Arbitrum DAO (voting starts on Thursday, Aug 8)Entropy Advisors is requesting  6M ARB to work exclusively with the ArbitrumDAO for one year. This consists of US$2.47M in ARB for an operating budget with a ~10% margin/contingency, and a potential bonus of 1.5M ARB maximum which the DAO can decide to distribute near the end of the 1 year mark.The receiving address for the 6M ARB will be a Foundation-controlled multi-sig SAFE address. Any excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.Entropy Advisors aim to be a Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS) broker for the the DAO, and serve as a liaison between key stakeholders in the ArbitrumDAO and ecosystem. This enables the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.Since inception 5 months ago, Entropy has led key discussions and proposals like GovHack Brussels, adjusting the minimum base fee, the multi-sig support (MSS) service for the DAO, and improving predictability for DAO ops.Snapshots⚡️1.

Funds to Bolster Foundation’s Strategic Partnerships BudgetThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting for 250M ARB to further foster key strategic partnerships. All expenditures will follow The Foundation’s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals.Across both the Foundation’s grant program and strategic grants, the Foundation must have adequate reserves available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners simultaneously, and be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.This puts the Foundation at a significant disadvantage because of a tight budget, being able to only use vested funds, and capital lockup in milestone-based agreements.The 250M ARB will enable better support on strategic partnerships, with focuses like expanding orbit chains, and being a gateway for many traditional and/or enterprise organizations to access the DAO. Tokens will only be allocated on an as-needed basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.The Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem.Forum post link here.3.

It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters, and drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.In addition to the delegation, the EventHorizon team is requesting for 200k ARB to maintain this public good for 1 year in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product. It also requested a separate 125K ARB grant for the 5 member Oversight Committee, however this will now be returned to the DAO (as this Snapshot to replace the Oversight Committee with the MSS for all related capacities and responsibilities, has passed).Forum post link here.2. Upgrade Governor Contracts by Transfering Timelock Roles to the New Governors (voting starts on Sept 13)This proposal will transfer the ‘proposer’ and ‘canceller’ roles from the current Arbitrum Core Governor and Arbitrum Treasury Governor to newly deployed Governor contracts.This upgrade was initially discussed as part of the Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO proposal, during which the community recognized the need for enhanced governance features, including proposal cancellation (allowing the delegate who submitted a proposal to cancel it during the delay phase) and flexible voting (enabling delegates to cast rolling, fractional votes, supporting future innovations like voting from Orbit chains and more).Accordingly, new Governor contracts have been developed and deployed with these improvements. To activate these enhancements and complete the upgrade process, the DAO needs to transfer the proposer role to these new contracts.This proposal has a longer than usual L1 timelock delay of 10 days, so the existing governors can still be used for proposing until the voting period of this proposal has ended.Forum post link here.Snapshots⚡️1.

If this Snapshot vote passes, it will eventually becoming a CONSTITUTIONAL AIP on Taly.RARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token (which is currently on Ethereum mainnet), which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. To register a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change.The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes with the upgraded token, reduce user costs, and improve overall accessibility for RARI DAO.4.

Delegate to Voter Enfranchisement Pool — Event Horizon  (voting starts on Aug 30)The EventHorizon team is proposing that the DAO delegates (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a non-optimistic 1-year renewal.Rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, the public access-voter block votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters, and drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.In addition to the delegation, the EventHorizon team is requesting for 200k ARB to  maintain this public good for 1 year in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product, and a separate 125K ARB grant for the 5 member Oversight Committee in monthly instalments.Snapshots⚡️1. Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship  (voting ends on Aug 30)The Ethereum Foundation is seeking sponsorship from the ArbitrumDAO to support an “Attackathon,” a large-scale security audit event organized by the Ethereum Foundation and hosted on the Immunefi platform. The Attackathon will focus on enhancing the security of the Ethereum protocol through three phases: education, active code hunting, and result evaluation.By supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum can leverage the findings to ensure its network remains robust against vulnerabilities. This initiative not only enhances security but also demonstrates Arbitrum’s commitment to the ecosystem.There are 2 tiers of sponsorships that the DAO could consider:Unicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment) (limited to two sponsors)Panda Partners (+30 ETH Commitment)"

These emission programs are in place to be implemented, but need additional time to distribute ARB at reasonable reward rates. However, due to some internal delay in launching GHO Safety Module and GHO Bridge, rewards for LM on Aave Protocol started later than expected, causing a delay in time and not being able to spend the amount allocated for ARB as plannedConstitutional AIP: Proposal to adopt Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy (Voting ends on Sept 19)This AIP proposes the adoption of Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum One and NovaTimeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion and allowing them to potentially capture arbitrage and backrunning opportunitiesProceeds from the auction are at the discretion of the Arbitrum DAO, with two options outlined in the proposal:collecting bids in ETHcollecting bids in ARBArbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come First-Served basis (FCFS), but relying solely on this ordering mechanism is not an ideal long-term solutionTimeboost, however, would provide many benefits for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchersTerms of Tenure for STEP program manager (Voting ends on Sept 19)In June, the DAO elected Steakhouse Financial to serve as the STEP Program Manager for 1 year to oversee ~$30 million diversified into liquid, stable and yield bearing RWAs. Steakhouse Financial had quoted fees of $174,000 in its applicationHowever, the overarching STEP proposal only accounted for 100K ARB for program management costs, which was recently converted to $86,581 and is therefore insufficient to cover 1 year of Steakhouse Financial’s feesAccordingly, this proposal seeks the DAO’s opinion on whether to:approve additional funds for Steakhouse Financial to operate for 1 yearshorten Steakhouse Financial’s tenure to 6 monthshold another RFP to find a new STEP Program Manager to be paid ~$86,581 for 1 yearnot have a program manager which would result in liquidation of the RWAs and STEP programArbitrumDAO Off-site (Voting ends on Sept 20)This proposal seeks to determine the format of a potential DAO off-site (following on from this previously passed temperature check), which would enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among DAO members and key stakeholdersThe voting options are as follows:IRL off-site next to a major event (i.e. Devcon in Thailand), costing ~$116k + 10k contingencyIRL off-site separate from a major event (December 2024), costing ~$156k + 10k contingencyOnline off-site (October or December 2024), costing ~$35k + 5k contingency"

As a result, many community members choose to transfer their token-weighted voting power to representatives (i.e. delegates) whose values align with their own and who are better positioned to make informed decisions for the DAO. By doing so, token holders can ensure their interests are represented without needing to actively track and vote on every proposal.Accordingly, delegation allows token holders to passively engage in the governance of the ArbitrumDAO.It is important to note that:When you delegate, you still retain full ownership of the tokens, but your selected delegate will wield the voting power associated with those tokensEven if you have already delegated your voting power, it is worth checking whether or not your delegate is still active. You can do so by finding your delegate’s profile here, to check whether they have voted in recent proposals and see their delegate score and contributor metricsThrough the Tally UI, you can change or revoke your delegation at any time (as described below)What should I consider when delegating?The delegate’s vision and values for the ArbitrumDAO (as seen in the recordings above)The delegate’s relevant experience (as seen in the recordings above)The delegate’s position on proposals (as seen in their delegate statements and/or Tally profiles)The delegate’s level of engagement within the community and their willingness to listen and respond to feedbackThe delegate’s level of technical expertise and their experience in the spaceThe amount of Voting Power that the delegate already has, with the aim of keeping voting power more decentralizedThe delegate’s track record, if they have one (e.g. whether they have voted in recent proposals, as well as their delegate score and contributor metrics)**If you would like to delegate your voting power to a newer delegate, please bear in mind that these delegates might not yet have a high delegate score as this is developed over time.How do I delegate?Visit the Tally UI to examine delegate profilesTo browse by delegates who participated in (Re)delegation week, filter by “Featured Delegates”1600×477 345 KBOnce you have selected a delegate that aligns with your vision and values for the Arbitrum DAO, connect your wallet to Tally by clicking on “Connect Wallet” and selecting the address that holds your $ARB tokens1600×560 843 KBNavigate to “My Voting Power” from the drop-down menuSelect the “Delegate/Update Delegation” button1198×394 196 KBSelect the “Someone Else” button1062×424 267 KBSearch for the delegate you want to vote for by typing their Ethereum address or their name in the search bar, or search for the delegate you want to vote for through the Community tabClick on the “Delegate” button next to the delegate you’ve chosenConfirm the delegation by clicking on the “Delegate” button on the pop-up window that appearsWait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Arbitrum One networkTo find out more about how to delegate your voting power, check out the Arbitrum Governance Docs.What if I don’t want to delegate to anyone?If you don’t want to or are unable to delegate your voting power to a delegate, there is also the option to delegate to the “exclude address” (0x00000000000000000000000000000000000A4B86). This would ensure that your $ARB is explicitly excluded from the count of circulating votable tokens (i.e. your $ARB would not be used for voting and would be excluded from ArbitrumDAO’s quorum calculations).To do so:Follow the steps until Step 5, aboveFrom the “My Voting Power” section, select “Delegate/Update Delegation”Select the “Exclude from Quorum” buttonWait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Arbitrum One networkFree (Re)delegation on Tally!During the month of August, to encourage active (re)delegation, Tally will be turning on transaction relaying - this means that delegators can choose a delegate for free, as gas fees incurred for 1 per address to select a delegate, will be refunded*.*To prevent spam, this refund will only be available to accounts that have had a balance of at least 1 ARB, as of July 15.What is (Re)delegation WeekAs a reminder, the aim of the initiative is to strengthen active and decentralized delegation within ArbitrumDAO by:bringing awareness to the importance of participation, and promoting diverse voiceshaving more delegates actively participate in governanceencouraging community members to (re)assess and (re)assign their voting power to active delegates who best align with their values and vision for the DAOCheck out this forum post to learn more about (Re)delegation Week.Check out this forum post to learn more about the role of delegates and delegators, and how and why to become a delegate or delegator.Key TermsToken holders: Members of the Arbitrum community who hold the $ARB tokenDelegate: A party that can vote on Arbitrum Governance proposals 1.

One way to participate in ArbitrumDAO governance is by becoming a delegate, (and you don’t even need to hold $ARB to do so!).Benefits:Being active in governance will help build your credibility and exposure to the DAO as well as the wider Web3 ecosystem (which values practical governance experience and contributions over CVs)Being actively involved in governance allows you to connect and build networks with the best builders and talents in the DAOYou can get rewarded for your contributions as a delegate, as per the Delegate Incentive ProgramYour voice will further the decentralization and diversity of ArbitrumDAOThere are many $ARB token holders that could provide you with substantial voting powerFind out more about participating in ArbitrumDAO governance → Diving Into Governance.Find out more about how to become a delegate here → How to Become a Delegate; and here → How to Build a Strong Delegate Platform.Why should you be a delegator?Token holders have two options for participating in governance: they can either vote directly on proposals by delegating to themselves, or delegate their voting power to a representative.Keeping up with all aspects of governance can be challenging. As a result, many community members choose to transfer their token-weighted voting power to representatives (i.e. delegates) whose values align with their own and who are better positioned to make informed decisions for the DAO. By doing so, token holders can ensure their interests are represented without needing to actively track and vote on every proposal.Accordingly, delegation allows token holders to passively engage in the governance of the ArbitrumDAO.It is important to note that:When you delegate, you still retain full ownership of the tokens, but your selected delegate will wield the voting power associated with those tokensEven if you have already delegated your voting power, it is worth checking whether or not your delegate is still active. You can do so by finding your delegate’s profile here, to check whether they have voted in recent proposals and see their delegate score and contributor metrics (if they have opted in for this to be shown via Karma)Through Tally, you can change or revoke your delegation at any time.When selecting a delegate, consider the following:The delegate’s values, as outlined in the Constitution and their position on proposalsThe delegate’s track record, if they have one (e.g. check whether they have voted in recent proposals and see their delegate score and contributor metrics)The delegate’s level of engagement within the community and their willingness to listen and respond to feedbackThe delegate’s level of technical expertise and their experience in the spaceThe amount of Voting Power that the delegate already has, with the aim of keeping voting power more decentralizedVisit Tally to examine delegate profiles, and if you identify a delegate whose values align with yours, you can seamlessly delegate your token’s voting power through the Tally interface.Find out more about how to delegate your voting power, here → How to Delegate your Voting Power.Key TermsToken holders: Members of the Arbitrum community who hold the $ARB token.Delegate: A party that can vote on Arbitrum Governance proposals.

There are ~436K delegators and ~260K delegates who have enabled the DAO to vote on over 280 Snapshot and 30 Tally proposals. However, to further decentralization and diversity, ArbitrumDAO needs to increase its number of active delegates.Fast-forward to today, plenty of new contributors have become paramount in driving the DAO forward. However, many of these recent contributors have little-to-no delegation power and therefore, cannot significantly partake in decision-making. This is because most delegators delegated their voting power soon after the DAO’s inception, and may not have reassessed their delegations since. Additionally, the Arbitrum community has grown over the past year, meaning that many $ARB token holders have a significant amount of voting power that could, potentially, be delegated to active delegates.Accordingly, (Re)delegation Week aims to enable these newer and active contributors to step up, make themselves heard, and potentially get more voting power to become more involved in governance.The figures below reiterate the importance of (Re)delegation Week. As of July 1, 2024:~10% of circulated $ARB is delegated (i.e. 90% is undelegated)~35% of $ARB token holders are delegators (i.e. have delegated their voting power to themselves or to someone else)~6% of circulated $ARB is actively used for voting (based on the percentage of $ARB used for Tally voting out of the circulating $ARB supply, in the past 3 months)TL;DR: ArbitrumDAO needs enhanced voter activation, which can be enabled by:having more $ARB token holders (i.e. delegators and potential delegators) participate in governance by delegating their voting power to active delegates; and,having more delegates actively participate in governance.TimelineBuild up to (Re)delegation Week (Now till Jul 16, 2024)There will be a governance call on July 15 at 14:30 UTC to discuss the perks and process of becoming a delegate.

I","Enhancing Grant Programs for Decentralized Projects: Challenges and SolutionsIntroductionGrant programs play a pivotal role in the success of various projects, particularly decentralized ones. They act as a lifeline for public infrastructure, attract talented builders, and cultivate an ecosystem of skilled participants. Despite their importance, executing grant programs effectively is notoriously challenging due to misalignments between stakeholders, cost underestimations, and other issues. In this article, we will discuss these challenges and offer suggestions for improvement, drawing on insights from the CEO and Co-founder of Tally.xyz, to help enhance Arbitrum grant programs and create awesome things together.Introducing MyselfMy name is Dennison Bertram, CEO and Co-founder of Tally.xyz and an Arbitrum Delegate. I previously founded DappHero and served as the first Developer Advocate at OpenZeppelin. Tally played a key role in Arbitrum’s initial decentralization, and we’ve gained valuable insights from working with numerous DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem. In this post, I’ll summarize our experiences and lessons learned from grant programs, which are crucial to the success of large-scale public infrastructure projects like Arbitrum.The Importance of Grant ProgramsGrant programs are critical to the success of projects for several reasons:They support public infrastructure and independent builders who require funding for their efforts. Without grant programs, many valuable projects would struggle to attract the necessary resources and talent to make an impact.They incentivize talented builders to enter the ecosystem and provide value through their work. By offering financial incentives, grant programs attract skilled professionals who contribute their expertise to drive innovation and growth.They help contributors allocate their time and resources to projects that can support their real-world needs. Grants enable builders to focus on projects that have the potential to generate sustainable income and create meaningful impact.They grow an ecosystem of experienced participants, fostering a community where the best minds compete to provide ever-greater value. As more individuals and teams join the ecosystem, they share knowledge, collaborate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.Challenges of Grant ProgramsGrant programs face numerous challenges, including:1. Misalignment between grant committees, grantees, projects, and communities.Different stakeholders may have conflicting goals and priorities, leading to inefficiencies and tensions in the grant distribution process.2. Underestimation of the costs of building working projects.Communities may not fully understand the financial requirements of developing high-quality software or infrastructure, resulting in insufficient funding for projects to succeed.3. Failure to calculate the real-world costs of receiving grants, such as taxation.Communities may be unaware that a significant portion of grant funding may be lost to taxes, limiting the resources available to grantees.4. Inadequate consideration of grant recipients’ cost of living.Communities may unintentionally impose unfair financial burdens on grantees by failing to account for regional differences in living expenses.5. Difficulty aligning grants with the long-term goals of the parent project.Grants committees may struggle to allocate resources effectively due to a lack of clear guidance or understanding of the parent project’s objectives.6. The prevalence of decentralization theater, which can lead to stagnation and project death.Grants programs that prioritize appearances over substance may become vulnerable to insider capture, inflated award amounts, and diminished oversight.7. Difficulty fulfilling grant expectations and ensuring follow-up from the parent organization.Grantees may not receive adequate support or feedback from the parent organization, limiting the potential impact and adoption of their work.8. A lack of clear rules and support for grantees.Unclear expectations and insufficient guidance can leave grantees feeling overwhelmed or unsupported, leading to subpar project outcomes.9. Inefficient allocation of resources and misaligned incentives for successful grantees.The grant distribution process may not adequately reward top talent, resulting in reduced motivation and suboptimal project outcomes.10. Structural resistance to new ideas and risk averse behaviorPoorly designed stakeholder involvement in grants programs can lead to “death by committee” where little novel or pioneering work is accomplished because the penalty for failure outweighs the benefits of exploration.Solutions for Improving Grant ProgramsDespite these challenges, grant programs remain crucial for the success of decentralized projects. Here are some suggestions for enhancing grant programs:1. Fund more research:Research grants can justify their own future work streams and help identify new topics for grants. By supporting research, grant programs can encourage the exploration of cutting-edge ideas that drive innovation and growth in the ecosystem.2. Implement an RFP process:Request for Proposals (RFP) can help align expectations and requirements between grant committees and grantees. By clearly outlining project goals, scope, and deliverables, RFPs can help attract the right talent and ensure that resources are allocated efficiently. Not all grants need to be RFPs, but for large or core grants RFP processes can identify the best candidates for a grant, enhance transparency on selection process, and foster collaboration opportunities between teams.3. Foster mentorship opportunities:Connecting grantees with experienced mentors within the parent organization can provide valuable guidance and support. These relationships can help grant recipients overcome challenges and contribute valuable feedback to the ecosystem. A mentor program itself can be a valuable grant, although selection of mentors should be thoughtful and mentors compensated with vesting tokens to ensure the role is taken seriously. Oversight can be done via anonymous feedback.4. Encourage collaboration between grantees:Fostering collaboration among grant recipients can lead to the sharing of knowledge, skills, and resources. This collaborative environment can drive innovation and improve the overall quality of projects within the ecosystem. Where possible, grants processes should strive to incorporate collaboration between recipients.5. Develop clear guidelines and expectations:Providing clear guidelines, timelines, and expectations for grant recipients can help ensure that projects stay on track and meet their objectives. This transparency can also help prevent misunderstandings and promote accountability.6. Regular progress reporting and feedback:Requiring grantees to submit regular progress reports can help grant committees monitor project development and provide necessary feedback. This ongoing communication can help identify potential issues early and ensure that projects are on track to meet their objectives.7. Create a tiered grant system:Implementing a tiered grant system can help allocate resources more efficiently and reward top talent. By offering different levels of funding based on project success and impact, grant programs can motivate grantees to deliver high-quality results.8. Consider the cost of living and taxation when allocating grants:To ensure that grantees receive adequate support, grant committees should take into account regional cost-of-living differences and tax implications when determining grant amounts. This consideration can help reduce financial burdens on recipients and improve project outcomes. This should not be used to penalize recipients in higher cost of living localities, but rather the ground expectations around cost for non-bounty style grants which aim to cover the costs of development, rather than reward some action after the fact.9. Foster a transparent and inclusive grant decision-making process:Involving the community in the grant decision-making process can help reduce the risk of decentralization theater and promote fair resource allocation. By fostering transparency and inclusivity, grant programs can maintain the trust and support of their communities.10. Provide ongoing support and resources:Offering continued support and resources to grant recipients can help ensure their projects’ long-term success. This support can include mentorship, networking opportunities, access to tools and resources, and ongoing feedback and guidance. Many grants fail to make a significant impact due to the lack of followup, or alignment. While not all grants need to continue past their deliverable, should there be ongoing costs to the success of a grant, there should be funding in place to support that with a clearly defined scope of lifetime.11. Diversify grant committees:Forming multiple grant committees with diverse expertise can help ensure that projects across various fields are accurately assessed and supported. This approach can lead to a more balanced allocation of resources and foster innovation across different sectors.12. Encourage research-focused grants:By funding more research projects, grant programs can support the development of new ideas and technologies. Research grants can help uncover new areas for exploration and inspire further innovation within the ecosystem.13. Offer flexible grant structures:Providing various grant structures, such as seed funding or follow-on funding, can cater to the unique needs of different projects. This flexibility can help support a diverse range of projects and contribute to the overall success of the ecosystem.14. Implement performance-based incentives:Depending on the nature and goals of a grants program, Introducing performance-based incentives, such as token rewards(vested), can motivate grantees to deliver higher-quality results. These incentives can also help grantees feel more valued for their contributions to the ecosystem.15. Develop an “upgrade” path for successful grantees:Establishing a clear path for successful grantees to receive additional support or funding can help ensure that their projects continue to grow and thrive. This approach can also help retain top talent within the ecosystem. While grant programs do not need to operate as “funds”, the ability for grantees to receive follow on investment can help grow the prestige of grants programs and accrue long term value to the ecosystem.16. Ensure legal and regulatory compliance:Grant programs should adhere to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including taxation and corporate governance. Compliance can help maintain the integrity and credibility of the grant program while protecting the interests of all stakeholders. Legal structures, such as an LLC with bylaws that define and constrain their roles and responsibilities can protect committee members from liability and unforeseen legal complications.17. Maintain transparency and accountability:Ensuring that grant programs operate with transparency and accountability can help build trust within the community and demonstrate the program’s commitment to supporting high-quality projects. Transparent processes can also help mitigate any potential conflicts of interest or other concerns. Grant committee members should be required to disclose conflicts of interest and be properly informed as to the processes required for dealing with material non public information to prevent accusations of self-dealing or insider trading.18. Implement robust application processes:A thorough and transparent application process can help ensure that grants are awarded to projects with the greatest potential for success. This approach can also help maintain the integrity and credibility of the grant program. In general, it is often best if the grant committee determines grant recipients, rather than by election of the community, but it is quite acceptable to promote on occasion a “people’s choice” category to provide inclusiveness for unexpected proposals.19. Encourage community engagement and feedback:Inviting input from the community throughout the grant process can help identify potential areas of improvement and ensure that projects align with community needs and values. This engagement can also help foster a sense of ownership and investment among community members. Opportunity for community feedback should be, where reasonably possible, constrained to specific periods of comment. Grant recipients should not be required to respond to community feedback and comment at random which can promote insecurity and undermine confidence. Feedback should also be collated and delivered in one document, rather than requiring recipients to read through continuously expanding forum threads.20. Monitor and track project progress:Regularly monitoring the progress of grant-funded projects can help identify any potential issues or roadblocks and ensure that resources are being used effectively. This oversight can also help maintain accountability and encourage grant recipients to stay on track with their project goals.21. Celebrate and share grant successes:Acknowledging and celebrating the achievements of grant recipients can help motivate and inspire others within the ecosystem. Recognition can also help build a sense of community and camaraderie among grant recipients, grant committees, and parent organizations. Too often grants programs fail to adequately promote the success of their grantees and their efforts. Communities should ensure that being a recipient of a grant is considered prestigious. This should be more than just a tweet or blog post.22. Foster a culture of innovation and excellence:Cultivating an environment that values innovation, creativity, and excellence can help attract top talent and encourage grant recipients to strive for exceptional outcomes. This culture can contribute to the overall success and growth of the ecosystem. This means an open mind to wild or untested ideas, but also accountability and intellectual rigor.23. Encourage diversity and inclusion:Promoting diversity and inclusion within grant programs can help ensure that a wide range of perspectives, ideas, and experiences are represented. This approach can lead to more innovative and well-rounded projects, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Diversity and inclusion should also take into consideration language and geographic location. To the extent possible and practical, major non-english languages should be accommodated.24. Develop clear communication channels:Establishing clear communication channels between grant committees, the community, parent organizations, and grant recipients can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards common goals. Effective communication can also help address any issues or concerns that may arise during the grant process. Where it’s not possible to keep the parent organization involved due to legal constraints, grant committees can refer to their charter to help align expectations in public.25. Implement periodic evaluations:Regularly evaluating grant programs can help identify areas of improvement, assess the impact of funded projects, and determine the overall effectiveness of the program. These evaluations can provide valuable insights for refining and optimizing future grant cycles. Committee members should provide evaluations initially in private, especially when there are potential issues to give grant recipients an opportunity to address concerns they may be unaware of. Following a round of internal feedback, an amended evaluation and feedback can be shared with the community. It is important to recognize that when dealing with grant recipients of diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences on the internet, it is normal that there might be a misalignment. Poorly executed public evaluations can lead to grant recipients being publicly shamed and maligned over even the smallest of mistakes or misunderstandings.26. Cultivate a supportive community:Fostering a supportive and collaborative environment within the grant ecosystem can help grant recipients feel more connected and engaged, leading to increased motivation and success. Encouraging a sense of camaraderie can also promote the sharing of ideas and resources, benefiting all participants.27. Encourage risk-taking and experimentation:Supporting projects that take risks and push boundaries can help drive innovation and uncover new possibilities. Grant programs should embrace experimentation and be willing to fund projects that may not have guaranteed outcomes but have the potential for significant impact. Moonshot grants need their own form of accountability when deliverables are unclear or potentially not possible. In these cases open development, public working groups, and public forums for updates can substantially derisk projects that are otherwise difficult to measure.28. Establish a strong feedback loop:Creating a robust feedback loop between grant recipients, grant committees, and parent organizations can help ensure that all parties are continuously learning from one another and adapting to changing circumstances. This feedback process can also help identify areas for improvement and inform future grant program decisions. The feedback loop also provides a strong communication tool to future grantees about expectations and process for being successful in the grants program.29. Establish clear metrics for success:Defining clear metrics for success can help grant programs evaluate the effectiveness of funded projects and determine the overall impact of the program. These metrics can also guide grant recipients in focusing their efforts and resources on areas that contribute to the program’s goals. Success metrics can be difficult to meaningfully measure, but they should be metrics that depend primarily on the effort and capabilities of the grant recipient. Metrics that require buy in or collaboration from other organizations or groups often leave recipients without sufficient control over their grant success.30. Share best practices and lessons learned:Encouraging the sharing of best practices and lessons learned can help grant recipients and grant committees learn from each other’s experiences and improve their approaches. This shared knowledge can also benefit the entire ecosystem, driving growth and innovation. Opportunities for sharing can occur at a Grantee offsite, and shared during community events such as Ethereum conferences.31. Variable scopes and durations:In addition to the creation of multiple grants organizations with different scopes, grant programs should also be given different predetermined durations of time before coming up for renewal. Historically, the effectiveness of grant programs can be difficult to evaluate, so it is important that grant programs are given sufficient time to show impactful. Grant committees with smaller scopes can be renewed at shorter intervals based on their mandate, while committees with much larger, more fundamental mandates, should similarly have larger timescale to demonstrate their effectiveness. In the early times of an organization, the Grants committee should be expected to spend a larger amount of time and resources understanding how to operate, while successive committees should be expected to learn and incorporate previous learnings and thus be more effective, sooner.32. Continuously evolve and improve:Grant programs should be committed to continuous improvement and learning, adapting their strategies and approaches based on feedback, evaluations, and changing circumstances. This commitment to growth can help ensure the long-term success and impact of the grant program. It is important that evolution should be baked into the assumption of the creation of grant programs, the failure of a grant program should be interpreted as a learning for the community and rather than devolving into debate and recriminations, the community should take learnings and move forward with a new experiment. Grants programs should be viewed as opportunities to innovate on technology, explore applications and grow a healthy vibrant and diverse community.In conclusion, effectively executing grant programs is crucial to the success of various projects, particularly in decentralized ecosystems. By addressing the challenges and implementing solutions to improve grant programs, parent organizations can foster innovation, cultivate a vibrant community, and drive the development of impactful projects. Continuous improvement, adaptability, and a commitment to collaboration will help grant programs remain relevant and effective in supporting the growth and success of the entire ecosystem.I hope this document will prove helpful to the Arbitrum ecosystem, and at Tally.xyz we are always excited to help where we can."

However, that guide doesn’t indicate WHY there is a gas floor price enforced at all.I’ve heard it mentioned (and got one response in Discord confirming) it’s to prevent certain attack vectors/spamming/DoSing of the chain, but nowhere is detailed if that’s a temporary thing, or a permanent thing.I’m posting this as a Governance discussion as I think a long-term plan should be decided-upon, and whatever that plan is, to make it more clear to developers and users.Assumption: It would be ideal for end-users if a gas floor price was not enforced, or if it was enforced, it was as low as possible.Assumption: There is a current possible attack vector that the current-enforced gas floor price makes it financially not possible for a bad actor to sustain.Therefore, questions I think needing clear answers:Is the attack vector the gas floor price is guarding against expected to always exist? (If it’s expected to eventually become obsolete, the gas floor price could be retired at that time)Are there other guards against this attack vector possible (theoretical, planned, or in development)? (If there’s better guards against that attack vector, the gas floor price could be phased out when they’re enacted)Is a planned step-down of the gas floor price over time possible (without risking the security/usability of the chain)?Why is Nova able to exist with a lower gas floor price compared to One?Would a governance proposal to reduce the gas floor price at a certain rate (e.g. reduce by 0.001 gwei/year) be a good idea? What ramifications would that have that would need to be addressed before enacting?Depending on what the answers are, an update to the documentation explaining why it will not be changing may be all that’s needed. But if it is possible to step down those limits, creating a governance proposal to do so could be the next step?"

By way of context, I was recently leading a focus group together with @dk3 so as to spearhead a proposal aimed at creating a ‘Procurement Framework’ for security-oriented service providers in the ArbitrumDAO. Below, please find our public call for your participation in a public consultation phase so as to solicit input on what you, the ArbitrumDAO community member, think of how the Procurement Framework should be structured.IMP: The Procurement Framework detailed below is merely a base-line framework aimed at being thought-provoking in nature so as to give some context to community members intending on participating in the public consultation.Your submissions can be made on the following Google Form: ArbitrumDAO [Security Service Provider Procurement Framework] [Public Consultation]THE CONSULTATION PERIOD: 10/11/2023 - 22/11/2023 (UPDATED) (MIDNIGHT)If you prefer to submit a document-based submission, please do so by sending it to: joseph@axisadvisory.xyzIntroductionOn the 3rd of November, DK (Premia) posted a proposal on the Arbitrum DAO Forums aimed at establishing a framework for security-oriented proposals via a consolidated framework (Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition). By way of a summary, the proposal on the Arbitrum DAO forum discusses establishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to consolidate the selection of auditors and security service providers within the Arbitrum ecosystem (for the purposes of this endeavor, we shall be referring to this consolidated framework as the ‘Procurement Framework).The Snapshot Vote for the establishment of the aforementioned Procurement Framework has since passed (Snapshot).The intent is to replace the current piecemeal approach with a structured, transparent, and fair framework, involving stakeholder participation and administered/facilitated by a Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as ‘PC). This would involve clear criteria for security professionals’ experience, qualifications, and pricing to ensure the ecosystem’s security. The process is designed to be inclusive and efficient, open to all security engineers, researchers, and organizations. The committee’s role is not one that will involve any form of gatekeeping, but will merely be there to facilitate this process and carry out certain key functions which are part and parcel of the Procurement Process.GOALSDraft a preliminary procurement framework that will be used as a baseline to solicit stakeholder input through a public consultation process. The public consultation period will be initiated on the 10th of November and be open for submissions until the 17th of November.During the public consultation period (and immediately following the conclusion thereof) , the intermittent focus group will assess submissions, and iterate on the baseline procurement framework provided in [1] so as to propose an optimised procurement framework in line with stakeholder feedback.Following [1] and [2], the intermittent focus group will submit two proposals to the ArbitrumDAO:The creation & nomination of members to form part of a procurement committee (referred to as ‘PC’) that will administer & facilitate the checks & balances as envisaged in the procurement process; andThe submission of the final procurement framework for ratification by the ArbitrumDAO through a governance vote.Following the conclusion of the above mentioned matters, the appointed members of the PC will signal the beginning of the procurement process in line with the ratified procurement framework and administered by the appointed PC.[Public Consultation Procurement Framework]1. ‘Needs’ AssessmentDefine and document the security needs of the Arbitrum Ecosystem:What type of security services do projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem need?Will different services necessitate different procurement processes?2. Defining Eligibility CriteriaTechnical Expertise: Providers must demonstrate expertise in blockchain security, including prior experience with smart contracts, the Ethereum network, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum.Reputation: A track record of successful security audits, with references and case studies.Certifications: Relevant industry certifications (e.g., CISA, CISSP, or equivalent).Compliance: Adherence to international standards for cybersecurity (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001).Tools and Techniques: Tools for detecting vulnerabilities, including static and dynamic analysis, and formal verification methods.Financial Stability: Proof of financial stability to ensure the longevity and reliability of the service provider.Innovation: Evidence of ongoing research and development in the field of blockchain security.Insurance: Adequate insurance cover for errors and omissions.3. Publication of the Request for Proposal (RFP)Scope of Work: Following the conclusion of the ‘Needs Assessment’ in [1], the PC will publish a request for submissions. This will be done via the ArbitrumDAO Forums wherein a detailed description of services required, including security audit scope, frequency, and expected deliverables will be provided by the PC.Submission Guidelines: Clear instructions on how to apply, including formats and submission channels.Evaluation Criteria: Metrics on how proposals will be assessed.Timeline: Submission deadlines and timeline for the evaluation process.4. Proposal SubmissionDocumentation: Proposers must submit comprehensive documentation, including company profiles, client testimonials, and detailed descriptions of methodologies.Demonstration: Providers may be asked to demonstrate their capabilities via a test audit or presentation.The goal is to establish fair submission periods & submission criteria.Ideally, submissions should be effected on a dedicated section of the ArbitrumDAO Forums. This way, the PC can already get a sense of community feedback prior to putting the security service provider through the procurement process.5. Evaluation of ProposalsInitial Screening: Verification of compliance with the minimum eligibility criteria.Technical Evaluation: In-depth review of technical capabilities, methodologies, and tools.Commercial Evaluation: Assessment of cost-effectiveness and value for money.References Check: Verification of the provider’s references and past performance.Interviews: The PC may conduct interviews with the top candidates.Emphasis should be placed on documenting each step of the procurement process and communicating select steps in a consolidated manner to the community for review & input.In this regard, the PC can set up a dedicated notion page wherein the aforementioned details can be inputted, and then linked from the Forum updates posted by the PC.6. Whitelisting, Onboarding & ContractingSelection: The PC will select the most suitable providers to be whitelisted for service-subsidies based on them validly passing the procurement process.The PC will facilitate Know-Your-Business processes so as to make sure that all prospectively whitelisted service providers pass standard KYB checks.Contract Negotiation: The PC will facilitate & administer the process for the finalization of the contractual provisions regulating the engagement between the service provider chosen by the projects & the project itself. Most importantly, the PC has to ensure that the pricing ‘advertised’ by the service provider for the service requested is consistent with the agreement.Approval: Final agreements will be reviewed and approved by the PC before signing.7. Performance Monitoring and ReviewRegular Audits: Random checks by the PC during the audit process so as to ensure compliance with SLAs.Feedback Loop: A system for feedback from the projects utilizing the subsidised services. This will be pivotal in ensuring that the PC maintains a certain level of quality assurance so as to consistently assess whether any factors that led to the service provider passing the procurement process have changed.8. Renewal and Exit ProceduresRenewal Criteria: Should the PC establish a quarterly/longer time period review process to reassess whitelisted service providers?Exit Strategy: Process for orderly termination of the service provider from the whitelist? (Example: if a service provider’s performance is unsatisfactory or if they no longer meet the eligibility criteria)9. Documentation and Record KeepingAudit Trail: All stages of the procurement process will be documented and records maintained for accountability and transparency.10. Public DisclosureTransparency: Key details of the procurement process and the list of whitelisted providers will be made publicly available, respecting confidentiality agreements.This procurement process is designed to ensure that only the most qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.We look forward to your participation in the public consultation process & will be active to answer any questions or queries you may have in relation thereto. To reiterate, this is nowhere near the final procurement framework that will be provided for community ratification, but rather a Draft [1] base-level framework so as to solicit community input.We look forward to receiving your submissions!Feel free to reach out to me on Telegram @immutablelawyer should you have any questions, queries, or issues with the Google Form!Kind regards,ImmutablelawyerAxis Advisory"

If the community sees ","Hello, Arbitrum community! In light of the ongoing discussion in the Bankless DAO proposal and the post created by Jengajojo on establishing a framework for service providers, the Atoma team wishes to contribute our insights. We’ve crafted a comprehensive framework to address such scenarios. Our goal is to stimulate the discussion around this subject, gather community feedback, and lay the foundation for a robust Arbitrum framework for marketing & growth service providers.If the community sees value in it, the Atoma team is willing to contribute further to this project.Introducing a Robust Framework for Arbitrum Service Providers [Marketing & Growth]Establishing a proper framework for marketing & growth service providers for the Arbitrum protocol involves defining clear guidelines and procedures to ensure transparency, fairness, and efficiency. The Atoma team advocates for the implementation of a comprehensive framework, encompassing the following key elements:1- Documentation and Proposal Submission.2- Evaluation Criteria.3- Community Feedback.4- Trial Periods.5- Regular Reviews and Updates.6- Flexibility and Scalability.7- Communication Channels.8- Education.9- Legal and Compliance Considerations (Optional).1. Documentation and Proposal SubmissionRequire service providers to submit detailed documentation outlining their proposed services, methodologies, and expected outcomes.Service providers interested in contributing to the Arbitrum protocol should be required to submit comprehensive documentation that outlines the specifics of their proposed services. This documentation would serve as a transparent and informative basis for the community and the Arbitrum DAO to evaluate the merit of the proposal. The documentation should include:Introduction and Background: A brief introduction to the service provider, highlighting their background, expertise, and any relevant experience in the Web3 and blockchain space. Details about the team members involved in the proposed services.Scope of Services: A clear and detailed description of the services the provider intends to offer to the Arbitrum protocol. Information on how these services align with the needs and goals of the Arbitrum ecosystem.Methodologies: An explanation of the methodologies and approaches the service provider plans to employ in delivering the proposed services. Technical details on how the services will integrate with the Arbitrum protocol.Expected Outcomes: Clearly defined expected outcomes and goals of the proposed services. Metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the services.Timeline: A proposed timeline for the delivery of services, including key milestones and deadlines. An estimated time frame for the trial or pilot period, if applicable.Establish a standardized proposal format or template that includes key information such as the provider’s background, experience, and a breakdown of services.To streamline the evaluation process and ensure consistency in the information provided, the Arbitrum DAO should establish a standardized proposal format. This format will include specific sections for key information, making it easier for community members and DAO participants to review and compare different proposals. The standardized format may include:Executive Summary: A concise overview of the proposal, highlighting its key elements and objectives.Provider Information: Background information on the service provider, including previous experience in the blockchain and Web3 space.Service Breakdown: A detailed breakdown of the proposed services, methodologies, and any technical specifications.Team Members: Profiles of team members involved in the project, emphasizing their relevant skills and experience.Budget and Funding Request: A clear breakdown of the budget required for the proposed services, including any funding requested from the Arbitrum DAO.Timeline and Milestones: A detailed timeline outlining key milestones and deliverables, providing a clear roadmap for the project.Risk Analysis: Identification of potential risks associated with the proposed services and strategies to mitigate them.By establishing a standardized proposal format, the Arbitrum DAO can ensure that all necessary information is consistently provided, facilitating a more efficient and transparent evaluation process for service providers seeking to contribute to the protocol.2. Evaluation CriteriaDefine clear criteria for evaluating service providers. This may include technical expertise, experience in the Web3 space, track record, and alignment with the core values of the Arbitrum ecosystem.The Arbitrum DAO should establish a set of transparent and comprehensive criteria to evaluate service providers.

The criteria may encompass the following aspects:Technical Expertise: The provider’s technical proficiency in relevant areas such as blockchain technology, smart contract development, and layer 2 scaling solutions.Demonstrated expertise in areas specific to the proposed services for the Arbitrum protocol.Experience in the Web3 Space: A track record of successful contributions or projects within the broader Web3 and blockchain ecosystem.Experience with similar protocols, technologies, or platforms within the decentralized space.Track Record: An assessment of the provider’s past performance, including successful implementations, contributions, or collaborations.Consideration of any relevant partnerships, recognitions, or achievements in the blockchain industry.Alignment with Core Values: Evaluation of how well the service provider’s mission, values, and approach align with the core values outlined in the Arbitrum Constitution.Consideration of factors such as inclusivity, sustainability, security, and openness in their proposed services.Community should consider creating a scoring system to objectively assess proposals based on predetermined criteria.To enhance objectivity and facilitate a systematic comparison of proposals, the Arbitrum DAO may implement a scoring system. This system will assign numerical scores to each criterion based on the provider’s response and documentation. The scoring system could include:Technical Expertise (Score out of 10): Assessing the depth and relevance of the provider’s technical capabilities.Experience in the Web3 Space (Score out of 10): Evaluating the provider’s history of successful engagements within the broader Web3 ecosystem.Track Record (Score out of 10): Assigning scores based on the provider’s past achievements, collaborations, and contributions.Alignment with Core Values (Score out of 10): Scoring the provider’s alignment with the core values and principles of the Arbitrum ecosystem.The cumulative scores across these criteria would provide an objective measure of each proposal’s merit. This scoring system ensures that the evaluation process remains transparent and consistent, enabling the Arbitrum DAO to make informed decisions when selecting service providers to contribute to the protocol.3. Community FeedbackEncourage community input on service provider proposals. This can be done through forums, voting mechanisms, or community discussions.The Arbitrum DAO recognizes the importance of community involvement in decision-making processes. To foster transparency and inclusivity, the DAO should actively encourage community members to provide feedback on service provider proposals. This engagement can take various forms:Forums and Discussion Platforms: Establish dedicated forums or discussion platforms where community members can review and discuss service provider proposals.Facilitate an open dialogue, allowing community members to express their opinions, concerns, and suggestions regarding each proposal.Community Discussions: Organize community-led discussions meetings to provide a space for in-depth conversations about proposed services.Foster an environment where community members can engage directly with service providers, asking questions and seeking clarification.Consider community sentiment as a factor in the evaluation process.The Arbitrum DAO should acknowledge the significance of community sentiment as a valuable metric in the evaluation of service provider proposals. While the DAO would maintain a structured evaluation process, it would also take into account the collective opinions and preferences of the community. This consideration ensures that the chosen service providers not only meet technical requirements but also resonate with the broader community’s values and expectations.The integration of community sentiment into the evaluation process strengthens the decentralized nature of decision-making within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By valuing community feedback, the DAO will make informed decisions that align with the interests and aspirations of its diverse and engaged community members.4. Trial PeriodsImplement trial or pilot periods for selected service providers. This allows the community to assess the actual performance and impact of the proposed services.The Arbitrum DAO also recognizes the importance of practical assessments in evaluating service providers. To ensure a thorough understanding of the proposed services and their real-world impact, the DAO should implement trial or pilot periods for selected providers. This approach offers several benefits:Hands-On Evaluation: During the trial period, the community can experience the actual services provided by the selected vendors in a live environment.This hands-on evaluation allows community members to assess the functionality, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed services.Real-World Impact: By observing the services in action, the community gains insights into how they contribute to the overall objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem.Assessing real-world impact ensures that the chosen service providers align with the practical needs and expectations of the community.Set clear milestones and success metrics for the trial period.It is crucial to establish transparent criteria for evaluating the success of trial periods. To provide a structured framework for assessment, the DAO should set clear milestones and success metrics, including:Performance Metrics: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the specific services being trialed.Establish benchmarks that indicate successful performance in areas such as efficiency, reliability, and user satisfaction.Community Feedback: Continue to encourage community feedback during the trial period.Utilize community sentiment as an additional metric for evaluating the success of the services.Scalability and Adaptability: Assess the scalability and adaptability of the services to changing ecosystem needs.Ensure that the services can seamlessly integrate into the evolving landscape of the Arbitrum protocol.By setting clear milestones and success metrics, the Arbitrum DAO would conduct a comprehensive evaluation of service providers, empowering the community to make informed decisions based on tangible results and community feedback.5. Regular Reviews and UpdatesEstablish a schedule for regular reviews of service providers’ performance. This ensures ongoing accountability and allows for adjustments based on changing circumstances. Providers should be open to feedback and willing to adapt their services based on community and protocol needs.The Atoma team emphasizes the importance of establishing a structured framework for continuous evaluation and adaptation of service providers. This should involve the following key components:Scheduled Performance Reviews: Define a regular schedule for comprehensive reviews of service providers’ performance.These reviews should occur at predetermined intervals, providing a systematic approach to assess the effectiveness and relevance of the services offered.Dynamic Accountability Mechanisms: Ensure that the accountability mechanisms are dynamic and responsive to changing circumstances.By scheduling regular reviews, the DAO can adapt its evaluation criteria to evolving community and protocol needs, fostering flexibility in the governance framework.Adjustments and Adaptations: Establish a mechanism for making adjustments to service provider agreements based on the outcomes of performance reviews.This includes the ability to modify service scope, terms, or other relevant aspects to better align with the evolving requirements of the Arbitrum ecosystem.Open Communication and Feedback Loop: Encourage open communication channels between the community, the DAO, and service providers.Establish a feedback loop where community members can provide input on the performance of service providers, fostering a collaborative environment for improvement.Community-Driven Adaptations: Consider incorporating community sentiment and feedback into the review and adaptation process.Community-driven adjustments ensure that the services provided are aligned with the broader goals and expectations of the Arbitrum ecosystem.Transparency and Reporting: Require service providers to provide transparent and detailed reports on their activities and outcomes during the review periods.Transparency enhances the visibility of service provider performance, facilitating informed decisions during the review and adaptation processes.By implementing a robust system of regular reviews and updates, the Arbitrum DAO would maintain a high standard of service provision, adapt to changing dynamics, and ensure that service providers remain responsive to the evolving needs of the community and the protocol.6. Flexibility and ScalabilityDesign the framework to be flexible and scalable to accommodate the evolving needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Consider mechanisms for onboarding new service providers and retiring outdated or underperforming ones.In the pursuit of a dynamic and adaptable service provider framework, the Atoma team recommends to prioritize flexibility and scalability.

It’s fascinating to see how we can now have a stake in high-value assets through fractional shares, made possible by the amazing approach of tokenization. This shift is not merely about investment; it’s a transformative step towards democratizing asset ownership and making it more accessible to a broader audience.I’m keen to delve deeper into specific projects within this space. What are your thoughts on the current RWA projects that stand out in terms of their approach to tokenization and overall impact? Are there any particular trends or developments in the RWA space that you find particularly promising or challenging?I believe this forum is the perfect place to exchange ideas and insights about these emerging trends. Your experiences, thoughts, and predictions could provide invaluable perspectives as we navigate this evolving landscape together."

The ‘Arbitrum Research and Development Collective (ARDC)’ was est","TL;DRThe ARDC finished its 6-month term from April 1st to October 1st, 2024.During its term, it published 42 deliverables in the forum.The ARDC’s multisig was funded with 1,761,000 ARB, of which 1,753,466.42 ARB was used.The remaining 7,533.58 ARB are to be returned to the treasury.We will be hosting a call on Monday 7th of October at 14:00 UTC to discuss the conclusion of ARDC and answer any questions you might have.IntroThe ‘Arbitrum Research and Development Collective (ARDC)’ was established on January 26, and it consisted of 4 member seats occupied by 6 DAO-elected entities:L2BEAT & Ant Federation as the DAO Advocate(s)Blockworks Research & Delphi Digital as the Research Member(s)OpenZeppelin as the Security MemberChaos Labs as the Risk MemberThe primary purpose of the ARDC was to ‘provide objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making, thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.’ Please see the corresponding section below for a more detailed breakdown of the exact mandate outlined in the proposal.The ARDC’s official start date was April 1st since there were delays with the KYC/KYB process and the signing of legal agreements between members and the Arbitrum Foundation. The term of the ARDC was to be six months, and therefore, the ARDC was to conclude on October 1st. ARDC’s MandateAlthough the ARDC’s mandate is challenging to capture in a single sentence or paragraph, we’ve compiled a list of references from the original proposal to help you understand it.The mandate of the ARDC was outlined as follows:The primary mandate of the ARDC will be to provide objective assessments of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making, thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.Aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.Forum Proposal Review & AssistanceImpartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC to aid delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.These reports would double as tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will assist proposers on an on-request basis to optimize and structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to Arbitrum.Review on Chain Proposal Code UpdatesThrough manual and automated code reviews, ARDC will offer security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues.Audit Executables of different proposals.Quantitative AssistanceAdding an element of quantitative rigor to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.Identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.Project Management [On a Request-Basis]Aim to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.Tooling Creation and EnhancementDevelop and enhance security assessment tools to strengthen the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem and ensure that proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.Research New MechanismsARDC will objectively analyze and contribute to developing innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.Delegate EngagementARDC’s processes will incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.Growth InitiativesThrough content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC will attract developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.Operational ParametersThe following operational parameters were to be implemented by the ARDC for the DAO to oversee its operations properly.Meeting minutes to be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;Monthly report detailing the performance of the ARDC;Bi-weekly calls with the community with the ARDC;A public Asana/Airtable dashboard for members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.DeliverablesOver the six-month term, the ARDC worked on and published 42 deliverables, ranging from retroactive analysis of incentive programs to risk assessments of different proposals and security reviews of executable proposals.

Different deliverables had different and varying levels of complexity, and therefore, it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison.*Although Blockworks didn’t pick up this workstream specifically as a member of the ARDC, we’ve included it in the list since it was relevant to the Timeboost discussion and since it was published in the overall context of the work ARDC was doing on that front.***These deliverables haven’t been published on the forum yet. Although the ARDC term has concluded, the engagement of the members will be officially regarded as ‘concluded’ upon publishing the final deliverables.The DAO Advocate was responsible for coordinating the ARDC and acting as a bridge between the DAO and the collective’s members. Over the ARDC’s term, we received 11 requests, 8 of which materialized into a deliverable published on the forum.One issue that became apparent was that although the DAO Advocate was responsible for representing the DAO and maintaining the ability to direct and oversee the ARDC, the mandate to ‘function as a bridge between the DAO and the ARDC’ was somewhat vague.Since the level of discretion the DAO Advocate could exercise was left open to interpretation, we decided to operate so that anyone could submit a request to the ARDC (see the ‘Transparency & Communication’ section for more info on how), but the DAO Advocate was in charge of prioritizing the work undertaken by the ARDC members.In theory, that meant that all requests were optimistically ‘approved’ to be worked on by the ARDC, but the DAO Advocate could at any point prioritize new requests. In practice, that meant that some requests were constantly left on the back burner and eventually never materialized.When a member of the ARDC had no active workstream, and the DAO had no requests for them to undertake one, we took the initiative to assign one to them internally.Transparency & CommunicationThroughout the ARDC’s term, we implemented all the operational parameters outlined in the original proposal and went the extra mile to ensure constant communication with the DAO and its stakeholders.Meeting minutes for every ARDC meetingWe kept publicly accessible meeting minutes for all ARDC meetings, including the ones not open to the DAO’s participation. For each meeting, we kept attendance, included the agenda going into the meeting, and noted down the items that we discussed (categorized by member), including action items and ETA of deliverables.Monthly report detailing the performance of the ARDCFrom the very beginning, we published a ‘DAO Advocate Communication Thread’ on the forum under a specially created forum category, which we updated monthly. The monthly updates included a summary of the deliverables the ARDC had published in the month prior, an overview of active workstreams the ARDC members were working on, and a list of requests from DAO contributors (if any).Bi-weekly calls with the community with the ARDCThe ARDC was syncing every week every Monday (except public holidays, in which cases the call was moved) at 12:00 UTC. The meeting was publicly available every second Monday and was shared on the Arbitrum DAO Governance Calendar.A public Asana/Airtable dashboard for members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.We used Notion to host a dashboard outlining all the tasks the ARDC had completed or was working on at any given time. The Notion dashboard was publicly accessible to everyone.DAO Advocate Discussion with Arbitrum DAOOn Friday 10th of May, we hosted an open call to discuss the ARDC and the DAO Advocate’s role and invited delegates and active contributors. Notes from the call can be found here.L2BEAT Arbitrum Office HoursAs the DAO Advocate, L2BEAT leveraged their weekly office hours to discuss anything relevant to the ARDC with interested parties. This was another avenue for people to reach the ARDC.Telegram availabilityAnyone could reach the DAO Advocate (L2BEAT) on Telegram to communicate via instant messages or async in case of timezone differences.Monthly Open Governance CallLastly, we attended all monthly Arbitrum Open Governance Calls to provide updates, answer any questions, and generally discuss ARDC matters with the broader community.FinancesDisclaimer: Although the DAO Advocate wasn’t responsible for the finances of the ARDC, we decided to include this section for ease of access and reference. The information was collected from publicly accessible information (e.g. forum posts and onchain transactions). The payments to members and the general handling of funds was up to the multisig setup for this purpose.The ARDC was funded with a total of 1,761,000 ARB, valued at $3,009,385.55 at the time of transfer (now the same amount of ARB would be equal to ~ $1,058,265.91, or roughly 65% less). The funds were kept in a ⅗ multisig at the following address since MSS wasn’t a thing when ARDC was established: arb1:0xd19Ed0E8E723fDb85a6a1480e5345FbCcE0BFF85. Budget BreakdownThe original proposal earmarked the following amounts for their respective purposes:665,000 ARB [Security] [Applicable Cap]665,000 ARB [Research] [Applicable Cap]335,000 ARB [Risk] [Applicable Cap]50,000 ARB [DAOAdvocate]1,000 ARB [per signer - per month for the 6-month term]$16,000 paid in ARB to ImmutableLawyer as retroactive compensation for drafting the proposal, coordinating its establishment and elections, and managing and administrating all related processes until the ARDC was fully operational.Applicable caps are the maximum amount of ARB a member will be eligible to receive throughout their engagement in the ARDC. They were introduced to avoid having to spent huge amounts of ARB in case of ARB’s price declining, as it ended up happening.Although the funds earmarked for each seat were denominated in ARB, the members quoted their service fees in USD during their application process. Only the DAO Advocate was to be compensated with a fixed, ARB-denominated amount of 50,000 ARB. Specifically, the quoted fees were as follows:Blockworks Research & Delphi Digital - $960,000OpenZeppelin - $750,000Chaos Labs - $320,000Total of quoted fees - $2,030,000Please note that the quoted fees were included in each member’s application, which the DAO voted on and was fully aware of.When the ARDC multisig was first funded, the ARB was more than enough to cover the total compensation of all members, the multisig signers, and the retroactive compensation to ImmutableLawyer (1,761,000 ARB against the ~1,280,000 ARB of expected spend with ARB at $1,70).ARB Price Decrease Impact on ARDC’s BudgetWhile the proposal had a buffer of about 30%, which could be used if ARB’s price decreased, ARB’s price dropped significantly more than the allocated buffer (~60%), which meant that the ARDC ended up with fewer assets on hand than its obligations.While there were discussions and even a proposal to inject additional funds into the ARDC, all members agreed to complete their engagement without extra funding to meet their USD-denominated fee quotes. Essentially, the members would be absorbing the ‘loss’ caused by ARB’s price decrease.The ‘Applicable Caps’ for each member came into effect, and the ARDC would only pay each member up to their respective ARB cap.Final SpendingOf the 1,761,000 ARB, the ARDC was funded with:50,000 ARB went to the DAO Advocate665,000 ARB went to the Research Member(s)665,000 ARB went to the Security Member335,000 ARB went to the Risk Member30,000 ARB went to the five multisig signers8466 ARB went to ImmutableLawyerFor a total spend of 1,753,466.42 ARB. The remaining 7,533.58 ARB are to be returned to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury.ARDC Conclusion CallWe’re inviting interested parties to a final call on ARDC to discuss all of the above and answer any questions you might have. The call will take place on Monday 7th of October at 14:00 UTC in this link."

It essentially functions as the bridge between the Arbitrum DAO and the ARDC.As the DAO Advocate, we’re committed to transparency and we’ll use this communication thread to regularly provide upgrades on what we, as well as all the other members of the ARDC, are working on.Following our election, we hit the ground running by first establishing a direct line of communication between us and all the members of the ARDC. We’ve also already had 2 calls so we can coordinate among all members of the ARDC to discuss the next steps and operational procedures going forward.ARDC Public Notion PageFor transparency’s sake, we’ve set up a publicly viewable Notion page that contains all information relevant to the ARDC’s operations. Specifically, there’s a section that will have meeting minutes from all the ARDC calls, and a kanban board that will contain all the tasks the ARDC will work on, is working on, and has worked on.Additional sections and subpages will be added if and as needed.You can find the Notion page here.CommunicationGiven the role, communication between the DAO and the DAO Advocate is essential. To that end, we want to make our communication channels known so you can reach out to us at any time.1) This communication thread. You can use this thread to publicly bring up topics in which our involvement in our capacity as DAO Advocate is needed.2) Bi-weekly status update call. As per the mandate of the original proposal, we’ll be hosting 2 calls per month that will be open to the public to address any and all topics relevant to the ARDC. During those calls, both the DAO Advocate as well as representatives from all the members of the ARDC are going to be present.The calls are going to happen every other Monday at 1 pm UTC / 9 am EST starting on Monday 8th of April 2024. You’ll find the links to the calls in the Arbitrum DAO Governance Calendar.3) ARDC Meeting Minutes. You’ll be able to find meeting minutes from each call (both private and public) of the ARDC in this Notion page we’ve set up.5) L2BEAT Arbitrum Office Hours. We already host weekly office hours where stakeholders can discuss all things relevant to Arbitrum with us. We’re inviting people to freely use our office hours to discuss DAO Advocate matters. The call takes place every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.6) Open Arbitrum Governance Call. The monthly open governance call is also a good place for discussions relevant to the whole ARDC. We’re always present at those calls and happy to discuss any topics relevant to the ARDC and DAO Advocate. The next call is happening on Wednesday, 3rd of April at 3pm UTC / 11 am EST.7) Telegram. For a quick and direct way to reach us, you can send a message to Krzysztof on Telegram. Turnaround time will be within 24 hours on a business day.Next StepsGoing forward, you can expect regular updates from our involvement in the DAO in our capacity as DAO Advocate in the form of written updates. Of course, you can find us to discuss anything in more detail in any of the communication channels mentioned above.From a process standpoint, all ARDC members are going through the KYC/KYB process to sign an agreement with the Foundation and have submitted the necessary documentation. Once that process is complete, we’ll be set to officially kick things off.Operationally, and in parallel with the KYC/KYB process, we’re working on identifying and deciding on key areas of interest in which the ARDC could already be of help, on top of establishing how we’ll collectively respond to the DAO’s needs as they arise.Call to actionWe invite everyone to participate in our inaugural call on Monday 8th of April at 1 pm UTC to discuss all of the above and more relevant to both the ARDC, but also Ant Federation’s and L2BEAT’s role as DAO Advocates."

If enacted, the proposal will publish a daoURI on the Arbitrum One network, creating a single source of truth for all the information about the DAO. No existing contracts will be modified and there will be no transfers of funds from the treasury.OverviewDAOs often have a large and growing amount of information surrounding them. This information is constantly changing as a result of the proposal process. Consequently, the information is often scattered and quickly becomes out-of-date as time goes on. EIP-4824 has proposed a common standard to create a single source of truth for all information about a given DAO. This information will be on-chain and publicly verifiable, and shall contain the latest aggregation of all data about the DAO.The API standard proposed by EIP-4824 defines a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) called the daoURI. It contains a variety of information on the DAO as shown below:{    ""@context"": ""http://www.daostar.org/schemas"",    ""type"": ""DAO"",    ""name"": ""<name of the DAO>"",    ""description"": ""<description>"",    ""membersURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""proposalsURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""activityLogURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""governanceURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""contractsURI"": ""<URI>""}This information is stored fully on-chain as a string in the JSON format as shown above. Any user can verify the information independently without relying on a third party to accurately report the latest information. Updates to this URI can be performed by permissioned actors after discussions with the community. Furthermore, community members can monitor event emissions for any changes to the URI, so any invalid or unauthorized changes can be easily identified.This URI contains references to other URIs which, in turn, contain information regarding DAO members, proposals, activity, governance, and the various contracts in the system. The format of these subcomponents follows a similar structure and is detailed below. Not all of the provided fields have to be used and some can be removed from the URI if they are not needed for a specific application.The URI can also hold arbitrary information beyond what has been shown above. For example, the standard can be extended by including links to specific proposal discussions or dashboards containing additional information about the DAO. These links can be stored on IPFS as well, thereby minimizing the centralization risk arising from a provider going offline.MotivationThe primary motivation for this proposal is to create a single source of truth for the Arbitrum DAO. Currently, the information about the DAO is scattered across multiple locations and is difficult to find for newcomers or casual participants. This information is also constantly growing and evolving, so any third-party collections of this data quickly become out of date. In addition, relying on third parties to organize and report information on the Arbitrum DAO introduces centralization risk that can result in censorship or misinformation. Changes to this reported information can also be difficult to track or contest when it is stored off-chain.By storing this information on-chain, a single, up-to-date source of truth is established. This cannot be altered by any third party and can be managed by existing governance with any changes transparently reported. This initiative will lower the barrier of entry to getting involved with the Arbitrum DAO for newcomers by organizing all of the relevant information in a single location. It will also increase accountability since the information is now freely available. Given that the information is stored and published in a single point, the overhead and maintenance efforts associated with publishing and consuming data will also be reduced. All in all, these changes are aligned with the community values of Arbitrum and make the DAO more open, accessible, and inclusive to participants.Technical DetailsNo changes have been proposed to existing contracts, nor has any additional spending been requested from the treasury. A new registration contract would be deployed by making a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory. This contact is currently deployed at 0x2Dac5DBbF1D024c1E0D9c92D3AeDa7618e15aDd7 and has previously been utilized by other DAOs such as Unlock protocol, Treasure, and 1inch.The registration will be done on the Arbitrum One network instead of the Ethereum mainnet. Moreover, the DAO’s governor timelock will be set as the admin which is in charge of setting the trusted managers. The managers are the permissioned entities in charge of updating the URI, and these trusted parties can be determined by discussions with the community.  Beyond this contract deployment, the daoURI would need to be created. While a specific implementation has not yet been proposed, it is safe to assume that it would include a description of the DAO, a list of all DAO voters, a list of all proposals (with title, timestamp, status, and discussion links), a link to governance documents, a list of all contracts owned/managed by the DAO, as well as links to various dashboards containing protocol information. All the links will be stored on IPFS.  In order to have the daoURI always report the latest information, governance could fully manage it, in which case an on-chain vote would proceed for each upgrade. However, as this may not be feasible, the Arbitrum Foundation could serve as a trusted manager for all future upgrades. DAOstar can also commit to maintaining the daoURI for a year, given an additional cost.There are inherent trust assumptions behind this proposal as the managers are to be trusted to perform timely and accurate updates to the daoURI. This trust is important since the indexers rely on the data returned by the URI, and in case executable code is returned, the indexers could be tricked into running unrelated tasks. Given the nature of the daoURI for this specific application, the users will only be expecting a particular, fixed response from the URI. The detailed specification for the format and structure of the URI are shown below and the subcomponent URIs have also been included. Not all of the fields are necessary and extensions to this existing data can also be made if desired. The primary security concern pertains to the length of the stored URI. Given that the URI can grow to an arbitrary length, the number of storage slots necessary to read/write or update will continue to grow as time passes. Thus, the gas costs are technically unbounded, resulting in the operation failing if more gas is consumed than what is available within a block. One possible solution is to store each article on IPFS and save the corresponding hash on the blockchain.daoURI{    ""@context"": ""http://www.daostar.org/schemas"",    ""type"": ""DAO"",    ""name"": ""<name of the DAO>"",    ""description"": ""<description>"",    ""membersURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""proposalsURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""activityLogURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""governanceURI"": ""<URI>"",    ""contractsURI"": ""<URI>""}membersURI{    ""@context"": ""https://www.daostar.org/schemas"",    ""type"": ""DAO"",    ""members"": [        {            ""id"": ""<CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier>""        },        {            ""id"": ""<CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier>""        }    ]}proposalsURI{    ""@context"": ""https://www.daostar.org/schemas"",    ""proposals"": [        {            ""type"": ""proposal"",            ""id"": ""<proposal ID>"",            ""name"": ""<name or title of proposal>"",            ""contentURI"": ""<URI to content/text of the proposal>"",            ""discussionURI"": ""<URI to discussion or thread for the proposal>"",            ""status"": ""<status of proposal>"",            ""calls"": [                {                    ""type"": ""CallDataEVM"",                    ""operation"": ""<call or delegate call>"",                    ""from"": ""<EthereumAddress>"",                    ""to"": ""<EthereumAddress>"",                    ""value"": ""<value>"",                    ""data"": ""<call data>""                }            ]        }    ]}activityLogURI{    ""@context"": ""https://www.daostar.org/schemas"",    ""activities"": [        {            ""id"": ""<activity ID>"",            ""type"": ""activity"",            ""proposal"": {                ""type"": ""proposal""                ""id"": ""<proposal ID>"",            },            ""member"": {                ""id"": ""<CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier>""            }        }     ]}contractsURI{    ""@context"": ""https://www.daostar.org/schemas"",    ""contracts"": [        {            ""id"": ""<CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier>""            ""name"": ""<name, e.g. Treasury>"",            ""description"": ""<description, e.g. Primary operating treasury for the DAO>""        },        {            ""id"": ""<CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier>""            ""name"": ""<name, e.g. Governance Token>"",            ""description"": ""<description, e.g. ERC20 governance token contract>""        },        {            ""id"": ""<CAIP-10 address, DID address, or other URI identifier>""            ""name"": ""<name, e.g. Registration Contract>"",            ""description"": ""<description, e.g. ERC-4824 registration contract>""        }    ]}ConclusionWe found the DAO URI proposal to be a reasonable step towards greater alignment with the community values of Arbitrum. No existing functionality is modified and no additional spend is incurred from the treasury. Additionally, the proposal will organize all the relevant information around the DAO in a single location that can be reliably verified on-chain. This will lower the barrier of entry to getting involved with the Arbitrum DAO for newcomers and casual users, while also increasing accountability as more information about the DAO will be made freely available and accessible. An exact specification has not been proposed for the contents of the URI, though this can be determined through further discussions with the community. In addition to this, the trusted managers in charge of maintaining the URI can also be designated by community discussions at a later date."

After back and fort","Treasury Backed Vaults Risk Analysis1920×960 40.5 KBIntroductionOn Jun 3, 2024, cupojoseph proposed a pilot stage for funding R&D for the implementation and execution of operating a treasury-backed vault (TBV). He suggests that leveraging a TBV and issuing a stablecoin against ARB (and other treasury assets) in the vault could be a more effective funding mechanism for grants and other initiatives–noting leveraging ARB to issue stablecoins could relieve ARB selling pressure.After back and forth discourse amongst the community, both in favor and against a DAO-owned TBV, members of the DAO (Entropy and L2Beat) expressed that funding R&D for this proposal is redundant given the ARDC. Hence, Blockworks Research and Chaos Labs were assigned the task of outlining the operational structure and performing a risk analysis of operating a TBV.SummaryChaos Labs has performed an analysis of potential ARB CDP Vaults for the DAO to access stablecoin capital without selling ARB.  Our findings can be summarized as follows:The ARB oracle is healthy and is not an impediment to launching these vaults.We recommend an initial liquidation threshold, where a CDP loan becomes liquidatable at 66% of the dollar value of ARB supplied.  There should be a 10% liquidation bonus awarded to incentivize liquidators to avoid undercollateralized positions and ensure that the CDP protocol avoids bad debt.We recommend an initial loan of 25% of the value of ARB supplied to limit the liability of the DAO to supply more ARB collateral should the value drop.Alternatively, the DAO could take a more aggressive approach by taking an initial loan of 44% of the value of ARB supplied. However, this would require implementing more conservative risk management processes to mitigate the risk of loan liquidation at a higher price, compared to a lower initial loan value.We recommend an initial debt ceiling of $12m.  This means that the DAO could borrow up to $12m safely against a minimum of $48m in ARB collateral at the outset.We recommend the DAO establish a ring-fenced safety buffer in ARB to cover any price drops in excess of what is forecast.IntroductionChaos Labs presents a thorough risk analysis concerning the establishment of an ARB treasury-backed vault. The primary objective of the original proposal  is to enhance the capital efficiency of the Arbitrum DAO treasury while addressing the inherent sell pressure linked to ARB token distribution. Given that a significant portion of the total ARB supply is held with relatively low on-chain liquidity, the token is potentially vulnerable to price manipulation. Therefore, it is critical to set an appropriate debt ceiling when listing ARB to prevent a profitable dump attack. The analysis by Chaos Labs highlights the importance of this precaution to ensure the stability and security of the ARB token within the treasury-backed vault framework.Volume and Market CapWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at data from the past 180 days. The average market cap of ARB over the past 180 days was $2.9B, and the average daily trading volume was $392M (CeFi & DeFi). We find the market cap adequate and the trading volumes reasonable as long as they are considered when setting appropriate debt ceilings.ARB Volume and Market Cap822×508 30 KBHistorical VolatilityThe analysis of ARB (Arbitrum) price volatility over different time frames reveals substantial fluctuations. On a daily basis, the annualized volatility is 84.6%, highlighting significant price movement each day. When extended to a 30-day period, the annualized volatility increases to 93.87%, indicating that the volatility is not only persistent but also more pronounced over a longer duration. Over the past year, the largest one-day price drop was recorded at -17.06%, showing a significant single-day loss. Furthermore, the most severe 7-day aggregate price drop was -33.54%, emphasizing the potential for considerable price declines within a week. These metrics collectively underscore the high-risk nature of ARB, marked by notable short-term and sustained price volatility.ARB Daily Price Change (%)1920×963 104 KBHistorical LiquidityThe cumulative depth plot provides a comprehensive visualization of the aggregate liquidity values for ARB on-chain liquidity across a range of price impact spreads, extending up to 10% in both directions—specifically, from ARB to USDC and from USDC to ARB.The plot prominently features two primary lines, colored red and blue, which represent the average liquidity values computed over the past 60 days under specific price deltas. These lines offer a clear indication of the typical liquidity available within this timeframe, smoothing out short-term fluctuations to give a more stable view of liquidity trends.Additionally, the plot includes several less prominent lines, which correspond to individual snapshot values of liquidity taken at various points over the same 60-day period. These lines provide detailed insights into the variability and distribution of liquidity over time, highlighting how liquidity levels may fluctuate on a daily basis.ARB Historical Liquidity719×539 98.7 KBA key observation from this plot is that ARB’s on-chain liquidity is relatively low when compared to its market capitalization. This is an important consideration, particularly in the context of potential liquidation events.Given the observed liquidity levels and their variance, as well as the potential for induced liquidation events and attempted market manipulation, according to our debt ceiling methodology we recommend setting a debt ceiling value at $12 million. This recommendation aims to balance the current liquidity constraints with the need to maintain system stability during liquidation scenarios.ARB/USD OracleArbitrum’s efficient and low-latency infrastructure enables the ARB/USD Chainlink oracle to operate with a very tight deviation threshold of just 5 basis points (0.05%). This tight threshold results in the oracle providing over 1,100 updates per day, ensuring the oracle price closely aligns with the current on-chain price, even with minor price fluctuations. This frequent updating is crucial for maintaining accurate price feeds and minimizing the risk of discrepancies.During this period, the minimum price delta observed between two consecutive price updates was -6.3%. This significant deviation occurred during a rapid price drop, highlighting the potential for large price swings even with frequent updates.ARB/USD Chainlink Oracle2048×1384 195 KBInitial Liquidation ThresholdGiven the current volatility metrics, which indicate high levels of uncertainty and price instability, we recommend launching with a Liquidation Threshold (LT) ratio of 66% and aligning with protocols like Aave by implementing a 10% liquidation bonus.Setting the LT ratio at 66% aims to mitigate the inherent risks associated with the underlying protocol. The chosen ratio takes into account the liquidation bonus, daily price drops, and ARB/USD oracle deviations. It provides a substantial buffer against potential price drops, which is particularly suitable given ARB’s liquidity and volatility characteristics, thereby enhancing the overall stability of the system. Additionally, the 10% liquidation bonus serves as a protective measure, ensuring that liquidations are adequately incentivized and executed efficiently, further safeguarding the protocol against extreme market conditions.Initial Loan Health RatioThe Initial Loan Health Ratio is the recommended LTV ratio of the collateralized ARB relative to the debt employed, based on the parameters we derived. This measure assesses the stability and risk associated with a loan at the time it is issued. By ensuring a strong Initial Loan Health Ratio at initialization, we can better protect the system against potential price drops.  This is important to protect the DAO against needing to continually supply more ARB to keep the borrow position healthy.In this treasury-backed vault, we no longer use probabilistic models for liquidation events based on an aggregation of positions. Instead, we assume the entire position is concentrated within a single user. This change simplifies the modeling process and focuses on a worst-case scenario approach.Assuming frequent system monitoring, we recommend starting with an initial health state that correlates historical daily price drops with the capital efficiency employed at system initialization. This method ensures that the system’s health is robust from the onset, taking into account significant past price movements to set a conservative baseline.Based on this assumption, we recommend the following:Initial Health State: Set an initial health state resilient to historical daily price drops. Analyze past price data to determine the worst-case daily declines and ensure the system can withstand these drops without triggering liquidations.Capital Efficiency: Balance capital efficiency at initialization with the need to maintain a high level of system health. While the system aims to be capital efficient, it must not do so at the expense of stability during significant price drops.Monitoring and Adjustments: Implement frequent monitoring to respond quickly to any changes in market conditions. This allows for timely adjustments to the health state and other parameters, maintaining system stability.Conservative Recommendation: Worst Monthly Price DropPrice Drop: -61.75%Liquidation Threshold (LT): 66%Initial LTV: ≤ 25.24%For a worst-case monthly price drop of 61.75%, the initial LTV ratio should not exceed 25.24%. This conservative recommendation is designed to offer maximum protection by setting the LTV at 25.24% or lower, ensuring the position remains secure even during extreme market fluctuations.Aggressive Recommendation: Worst Weekly Price DropPrice Drop: -33.54%Liquidation Threshold (LT): 66%Initial LTV: ≤ 43.64%Utilizing the worst-case weekly price drop of 33.54%, the initial LTV ratio should not exceed 43.64%. This more aggressive recommendation allows the treasury to leverage its position up to 43.64%, providing a higher potential return while still safeguarding against severe weekly market downturns.Safety Buffer in ARB:It is impossible to guarantee that any debt position will not require additional capital to remain healthy.  For this it is recommended to ring-fence a safety buffer in case the value of ARB drops more than previous fluctuations predict.  The size of the safety buffer should be set as a function of the health factor of the loan taken.Under the assumption that these recommendations are utilized, the treasury must adapt to price movements by instituting a safety buffer in ARB. This buffer allows the treasury to periodically top up the position, thereby avoiding liquidation. If the treasury reacts to top-ups at different rates, it must carefully manage these adjustments to ensure consistent protection against volatility.Taking the more aggressive recommendation, with an initial LTV ≤ 43.64%, comes with the necessity of more frequent monitoring and adjustments. This higher level of vigilance is required to promptly respond to market changes and top up the position as needed, thereby maintaining stability and minimizing the risk of liquidation. Conversely, following the conservative recommendation, with an initial LTV ≤ 25.24%, requires less frequent monitoring. This approach provides a larger buffer against price drops, reducing the need for frequent interventions and enhancing overall system stability.Interest Rate Implications:Setting interest rates at or above market levels is essential for adequately compensating for intra-protocol risk, particularly when dealing with highly volatile collateral assets like ARB. If interest rates are set too low, the CDP protocol faces multiple challenges, including insufficient compensation for the risks taken, increased sell pressure on the stablecoin, and potential bad debt accrual due to the instability of the collateral.Exotic collateral assets like ARB necessitate higher interest rates to account for their elevated risk. Without these higher rates, the protocol may fail to attract sufficient revenue and liquidity, exposing itself to instability. Ensuring that quantified risk parameters align with the protocol’s best interests and sustainability is crucial. This involves maintaining the stability of the underlying peg and enhancing the efficiency of liquidation mechanisms to swiftly address under-collateralization scenarios.By carefully calibrating interest rates and risk parameters, the protocol can:Adequately Compensate for Risk: Higher rates reflect the increased risk associated with volatile assets like ARB, ensuring sufficient compensation.Prevent Sell Pressure: Appropriately set interest rates can help mitigate sell pressure on the stablecoin, as it frees up additional capital to be utilized to incentivize value maintenance and stability.Avoid Bad Debt: Higher rates help manage potential bad debt accrual, given by the increased revenue injection, reducing the likelihood of instability.Weighted Aggregate Stablecoin Borrow APY Aave V2 and V3 Ethereum1920×1200 102 KBBelow we present a table with the average stablecoin borrow APY on Aave V2 and V3 associated with respective timeframes.TimeframeAverage Borrow APYLast 1.5 Years7.51%Last 1 Year8.68%Last 6 Months10.04%Last 3 Months8.85%Given that approximately 95% of the current $2.5 billion in collateralized stablecoin debt is secured against safe, blue-chip collateral assets such as WETH, WBTC, and wstETH, as illustrated below, the borrowing rate for using pure ARB collateral needs to be carefully adjusted to account for ARB’s inherent volatility.This adjustment is essential to ensure that the treasury can adequately compensate the counterparty for the increased risk associated with using more volatile ARB collateral. Unlike blue-chip assets, ARB can experience significant price fluctuations, as seen over the last few months, which increases the risk of collateral liquidation and poses a challenge to the stability of the debt position.Furthermore, the borrowing rate must also consider the persistent flow of dumping the stablecoin, which can exert downward pressure on its value and create additional instability within the protocol. By scaling the borrowing rate to reflect both the volatility of ARB and the dynamics of stablecoin dumping, the underlying protocol can maintain a balanced and stable environment. Additionally, it can potentially allocate generated revenues to incentivize peg stability mechanisms, enhancing the overall stability and robustness of the system.Relative Percentage of Collateral Backing USDC/USDT Debt on Aave V31920×920 91.2 KBCollateral Backing USDC/USDT Over Time on Aave V31920×921 75 KBThe pure interest component paid by the DAO is contingent on the specific derivation method used by the protocols, which could be a fixed derived rate or a utilization rate function, depending on the implementation. This would likely involve a collaborative effort within a prospective CDP stablecoin or lending protocol.DisclaimerThe reports, and other information and materials (“Materials”) made available by Chaos Labs, Inc.

Core Motivation: Arbitrum is a Top Protocol, B","This memo is a response to Frisson’s proposal to introduce an ARB staking program as a means of defeating voter apathy and enabling the token’s value on the application layer. We believe the proposal is very well reasoned, complete with a specification for how this would be implemented and a concrete estimate of how much this is going to cost. But there are details that need to be figured out that pertain to the sustainability of such an initiative.Core Motivation: Arbitrum is a Top Protocol, But ARB is Not a Top TokenThe Arbitrum L2 is home to some of the most widely used DeFi apps. Only Ethereum and Solana realistically fall ahead in terms of volume, traction, and innovation. However, this sentiment is not reflected in the ARB token. ARB has one of the lowest MCap/TVL and FDV/TVL ratios across the top chains today.Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 11.23.57 AM1010×496 34.1 KBA lot of this comes down to simple market dynamics. A significant amount of ARB has been unlocked over the past few months, resulting in a YTD performance of approximately -50%. In today’s landscape, investors expect to see some form of value accrual – whether it is direct (revenue share) or indirect (buyback and burn).L1 PoS chains have a fairly simple path to value accrual – nodes stake tokens and validate blocks on the chain, and in return receive block rewards and transaction fees from user actions. L2s are extensions of L1s, and thus cannot implement the exact same value accrual mechanisms. For L2s, the most clear-cut revenue generation path is via sequencer fees i.e. the delta between the cost of running the sequencer + cost of posting data to L1, and transaction fees collected from L2 users. This proposal seeks to use this sequencer revenue to create financial value for ARB – admirably, with the express goal of improving voter turnout in the Arbitrum DAO.A lack of financial value, and the perception of being “just another governance token” plagues all L2s today. This would likely be the first instance of an L2 attempting to bake revenue sharing into the native L2 token.While on the whole a thoughtful proposal, we believe there is nuance to this argument – and thus, there are considerations for delegates to take into account here.Understanding the Sequencer FiguresPre-Dencun, L2s like Arbitrum enjoyed high on-chain profits from sequencer operations. Note that we are only able to consider on-chain costs (posting data to L1) and not off-chain costs (compute to operate the sequencer). But things have fallen off considerably in a post-Dencun Ethereum.In the 30 days before the Dencun upgrade, the Arbitrum sequencer’s on-chain net profit was 835 ETH. In the 30 days after, that figure fell to 588 ETH – still a significant figure, but a 30% drop. However, we observe a continued drop post-Dencun.Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 11.27.13 AM684×1142 29.7 KBLayerZero’s airdrop on June 20 is an anomaly in Arbitrum’s sequencer collections. Without June 20, 2024’s data point, Arbitrum’s sequencer net profit for June 2024 stands at 224.6 ETH.Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 11.40.38 AM2068×1158 164 KBIn the 100 days preceding the introduction of Blobs, the median daily net profit for the sequencer stood at 25.25 ETH per day. In the 100 days after, the median daily net profit was 4.91 ETH per day.Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 11.53.07 AM950×186 10.9 KBThe point of all of this is to draw Delegate’s attention to the fact that past sequencer collection numbers are not all that relevant in a post-blob world. Yes, the sequencer still has significant on-chain net profits MoM. And perhaps it does make sense to implement a staking program funded by sequencer profits. However, it should be noted that the rate of incremental growth to this pool of capital has slowed down and is likely to continue at a similar pace.Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 12.55.39 PM2070×1158 185 KBSo if a version of this proposal is implemented, the community must evaluate a sustainable rate of incentivization taking the decrease in sequencer revenue into account.Looking beyond purely sequencing revenue for Arbitrum One, Orbit chain fees could end up being a contributor towards a staking program. Even though fee collections on that front are not significant today, there does seem to be a strong BD push to attract more builders to spin up their own Orbit L3s. Between existing Orbit chains like Sanko Gamecorp and Xai, to initiatives like the Gaming Catalyst Program whose KPIs include overseeing the creation of new Orbit chains, there is scope for Arbitrum-native revenue generation stemming from here.We recognize that initiatives around Orbit chains are still in their infancy, but this is a conversation worth having as sequencer revenue plateaus at a lower run-rate than what was set in 2023.Impact AssessmentDelegate Incentive ProgramTrying to evaluate the impact of a program that hasn’t been piloted or implemented yet is a difficult task that yields speculative results. The proposed staking program’s main goal is improving voter turnout in Arbitrum and getting a larger share of circulating supply to delegate their ARB.The Delegate Incentive Program by SEEDGov provides us some basis for where to start, having been implemented with the same end-goal of improving governance participation. SEEDGov published their analysis of the Delegate Incentive Program. You can read the entire analysis here, but to summarize:Delegate participation rate improved by 12% on Tally and 13% on Snapshot compared to three months prior. Tally votes tend to be more important as they are binding and execute protocol upgrades.Total participating voter power decreased by 10M ARB compared to the previous year.The DAO must be cautious of increasing quorum requirements as ARB circulating increases. More ARB will be required to pass quorum as unlocks steepen, necessitating measures to incentivize more delegation.The incentive program shows that there is an appetite to participate with more fervor when there is money on the table. The maximum incentive applicable is roughly 5,000 ARB per month per delegate, which at current prices ($0.70 per ARB) is about $3500. However, one should note that participating entities are the largest delegates in the Arbitrum DAO and not smaller fry. The program required delegates to have 50k+ of ARB voting power and a 60%+ total participation rate for eligibility. Over 97% of all ARB voting power is with delegates/voters in this cohort.Of course, it’s not entirely apples to apples. A staking program with intrinsic delegation would be an incentive for non-participating ARB holders to allow their tokens to be used in governance. The Delegate Incentive program stands to encourage existing delegates to be more active; this proposal tries to get ARB on the sidelines to enter the arena.However, a staking program where a commission model is implemented could hit 2 birds with one stone. For example, if 5-10% of total yield went to delegates and the remaining 90-95% went to delegators, this could act as a more organic form of the delegate incentive program – and one that is open to delegates of all sizes.All in all, the staking proposal and Delegate Incentive program are synergistic and attempt to reach a similar end-goal by targeting different holder cohorts.Compound Governance AttackJust this week, Compound Finance fell prey to a governance attack orchestrated by Humpy and the Golden Boys. The proposal sought 499k COMP – or 5% of the DAO treasury – that the Compound DAO would allegedly still own, but would be deployed to the Golden Boys’ goldCOMP product and could potentially be used to vote in the Golden Boys’ interest. This would have given Humpy and the Golden Boys control over a large majority of delegated tokens.There was a lot of outrage over this, but the proposal was ultimately canceled after reaching an agreement. Ironically, the agreement was for COMP to become a value accretive asset. Compound’s Growth Program has agreed to build out a staking program that rewards holders with 30% of market reserves (DAO’s portion of interest generated for protocol reserves) in exchange for Humpy canceling their proposal.The incident raised concerns over governance apathy and a lack of stakeholder alignment in DAOs – something that is very relevant to the ARB staking discussion. It’s now clear that governance apathy can have a serious detrimental effect for DAOs. Compounds’ proposal 289, which is Humpy’s initial proposal, saw a total of 42 addresses vote; 23 for and 19 against.Approximately 1.315m COMP was used to vote on the proposal, representing about 13% of total supply or 16% of circulating supply (per CoinGecko). A total of 2.64m COMP has been delegated per Tally as of the time of writing. This number likely reflects a significant increase in the aftermath of prop 289.13% of total supply voting is not a bad turnout per crypto governance standards in DeFi. However, there were many larger delegates who didn’t vote – which is the real issue here.One reason some of the larger delegates did not vote is because Humpy spread out their total tokens across a number of addresses. The tokens were used to vote and achieve quorum at the last minute, which minimized the DAO’s ability to launch a counter. However, if these delegates were still active and voted no, Humpy would not have been able to get the proposal passed.Efforts to incentivize delegates to be more active definitely look like the need of the hour. And growing the delegation pie is also important, which is why pairing delegate incentives with “delegation incentives” (for ARB holders that are inactive in governance) seems sound.The ENS SolutionIn April 2024, researchers that are part of the ENS DAO identified governance attack vectors similar to the one carried out against Compound. Their mitigation response included setting up a new delegate that could only vote “no” on governance proposals. This delegate address is backed by ENS tokens owned by ENS Labs and affiliated people.It’s a simple solution to the problem – use tokens in the DAO treasury only to ensure malicious proposals are stopped in their tracks. However, this does not address larger issues around governance tokens. Such as the apathy around the entire process and finding a long-term solution to grow a stimulated community base that is active in protocol governance.The veto delegate could also take decisions that are subjective, in the case of contentious proposals that some may consider malicious and some may consider genuine. How do you objectively ascertain malicious intent or DAO detriment before casting a vote? The ENS veto delegate was set up to be controlled by a multi-sig of at least two people, which makes it prone to bias. While currently the veto delegate has 3.99m ENS of voting power, the plan is to build a more robust system where the DAO’s entire 10m ENS can be put to use in governance.Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 12.58.46 PM784×360 25.4 KBIf there is significant concern over something similar happening with Arbitrum, the DAO should consider the viability of implementing something similar to provide near-term relief from the idea of a governance-based treasury raid.Constitutional ProvisionsOne thing to note is that the existence of the Security Council, and the rights conferred to the council by the Constitution, can also prevent meaningful governance exploits.Screenshot 2024-08-01 at 7.15.10 PM1594×420 41.5 KBIf the Security Council has the ability to use the $2b of ARB in the treasury to thwart objectively malicious proposals with no real community approval, then situations like what happened at Compound can be averted.Relying on the Security Council is not a long-term solution either. In an ideal situation, there is robust governance participation and these situations are organically quashed. We want the system to be naturally resilient to the highest degree possible, without the Security Council having to intervene. So the idea of delegate and delegation incentives are still relevant.Porting Insights for ArbitrumIn reality, the cost of a governance attack is directly related to participation in the system. If quorum is 4% and only 6% of tokens are active in governance, then the cost of an attack is – at most – slightly above 6% of token supply. If tokens are liquid and can be easily purchased and sold, or even borrowed, then it exacerbates the situation by making the attack more accessible.Another factor to consider is the sheer size of the Treasury. If Compound with approx. $480m in the treasury was subjected to such an incident, Arbitrum with $2b+ definitely is. Arbitrum requires 103m ARB (treasury) or 172m ARB (core) to hit quorum for proposals on Tally. 312m ARB have been delegated in total, resulting in a delegation/quorum ratio of 3 and 1.8 for treasury and core proposal respectively.As mentioned above, ARB’s lengthy unlocks will increase circulating supply and thus quorum requirements as well.Over the last 30 governance proposals on Tally, Arbitrum has had a mean of 164m votes and a median of 160m. Since the majority were treasury proposals, the average deviation of the median over required quorum is 55%. This is not terrible, but it is cause for some concern given the expectation that quorum will continuously increase.There are two separate realities here. The first is that governance apathy does not come to be in isolation. It happens when there is apathy for the product too. Compound’s TVL never recovered after the blow off in 2022, while competitors like Aave have forged ahead. Arbitrum is very much in the crypto zeitgeist, and it’s difficult to see how even large ARB holders who are not active in governance could sit on the sidelines when a $2b+ treasury is potentially under attack.The second reality is that you don’t want to play with smaller margins, especially when we know the voting quorum is going to increase. Growing the pool of delegated ARB is definitely a matter of concern. And while there are band-aids that can help mitigate these risk factors, more long-term oriented solutions are required.We believe the substance and reasoning behind the staking proposal is valid and legitimate. We also think the call for staked ARB to exist in LST form is valid, as keeping token liquidity hostage in the name of governance only stands to birth protocols like Convex that manage duration. However, there are still open questions around implementation. For example:Implementing a commission model for delegates could act as delegate incentive + delegation incentive. What is the right split to ensure adequate incentivization?What is a sustainable yield that can be promised given the tapering off in sequencer revenues? Would ARB emissions be on the table?What other revenue sources can be tapped into for future incentivization? Orbit chain fees?Does the Arbitrum DAO have the ability and appetite to set aside ARB to delegate across the top delegators to vote on behalf of the Foundation/DAO’s mandate?While staking could be lucrative for DAO governance, ARB holders, and the general perception around ARB and L2 tokens, there needs to be a clear-cut economic roadmap to ensure this isn’t done in a haphazard manner."

Chaos Labs supports the proposal, viewing it as a safe upgrade, but we do highlight several minor economic risks.Despite these minor concerns, Chaos Labs’ find no major blockers to the proposal’s implementation from an economic perspective.DescriptionTimeboost is a proposed upgrade that would affect the way transactions are ordered in Arbitrum blocks. A summary of this proposal is included here for ease of reference.Current Transaction OrderingTransactions on Arbitrum are currently ordered on a first-come, first-serve basis (FCFS) . There are no priority fees, meaning that the value created by time-sensitive transactions accrues to searchers and does not flow back to the DAO.First-come-first-serve transaction ordering has served Arbitrum chains well to date by allowing extremely fast block times. The default is 250ms, but this can go as low as 100ms, providing Orbit chains with the low latency needed for specialized gaming and DeFi applications.Harmful MEV such as frontrunning and sandwich attacks are prevented as there is no way to priortize any transaction earlier in a block.First-Come-First-Serve is also simple for teams to understand, implement and operate. This is a significant benefit to teams deploying Orbit chains using the Arbitrum tech stack.One consequence of FCFS transaction ordering is that it results in actors spamming the network when opportunities for MEV present themselves. Searchers submit multiple orders to capture MEV opportunities such as arbitrage and backrunning, in the hope that one of them is routed to the sequencer first.Timeboost Transaction OrderingTimeboost improves on the current Arbitrum transaction ordering policy by creating an express lane, giving the auction winner’s transactions a time advantage for inclusion at the sequencer. This is implemented by introducing a latency for normal transactions defined by the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter, while the auction winner’s transactions will be sequenced and included immediately.This creates a market for prioritizing transactions, while keeping the transaction costs for regular transactions comparable to the first-come, first-served (FCFS) model. By introducing market-based pricing for priority transactions, time-sensitive transactions cost approximately their long-term value, boosting sequencer revenue without affecting the cost structure for the majority of transactions.Auction participants need to deposit funds (for making bids) into the auction contract ahead of time and bid for express lane control for the upcoming round, which lasts 60 seconds. The auction closes 15 seconds before the start of the next round.It is important to note that Timeboost increases latency slightly for non-express lane transactions, while express lane transactions latency remains the same as under FCFS. This means that the express lane owner has their transactions included amongst regular transactions submitted to the sequencer NonExpressDelayMsec milliseconds prior. The timing of inclusion of express lane transactions remains uncertain for this reason, but where previously unknown profitable opportunities emerge, the express lane owner will have a healthy advantage to capitalize on them.For more details on Timeboost, see the original post, and follow-up FAQs.Economic Impacts and RisksTimeboost is extremely likely to achieve its stated objectives of:To allow the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.To offer the Arbitrum DAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users.The increased latency for non-express lane transactions will significantly reduce the incentive to submit multiple orders to capture MEV in most cases. Searchers should rationally assume that the express lane controller will use its latency advantage to capture most of these and not bother trying.At the same time, assuming at least two independent and competitive parties bid for the express lane, this latency advantage should be valued relative to the expected MEV opportunities in each round. This will increase revenues for the Arbitrum DAO without increasing the fees regular users pay, maximizing the potential for ecosystem growth in an economically sustainable way.While Chaos Labs generally views the Timeboost proposal as a positive step forward for Arbitrum chains and a safe upgrade to first-come, first-serve transaction ordering, we recommend monitoring for a number of potential second-order effects of this upgrade. It is not apparent exactly how the marketplace for the express lane will develop ex-ante. In this section, we highlight some possible ways this marketplace could develop and the associated risks.Should either of these or other unknown risks materialize, further iteration on Timeboost could be necessary in the future. The risks highlighted below are meant to serve as a preemptive set of second-order behaviors to monitor rather than any blockers to the rollout of Timeboost from an economic risk perspective.Secondary Markets for the Express LaneA likely scenario is that secondary markets develop for access to the express lane where searchers compensate the express lane controller for access when they need it. Should this occur, the express lane becomes more valuable and therefore the auctions should clear at higher prices, increasing DAO revenue.The express lane controller should rationally allow anyone willing to pay access to the express lane, creating a market for priority access on demand. Chaos Labs does not view secondary markets as a negative outcome, but acknowledges that much remains unknown around how they could unfold.Competition in the Express Lane AuctionIndependent competition is crucial for auctions to clear at efficient prices. The innovative and novel Timeboost ordering has no precedent currently and we therefore consider a range of potential market development outcomes for the express lane.There is a risk that a small group of participants could dominate the Timeboost auctions, potentially due to their superior ability to capitalize on MEV or through other advantages. This dominance could lead to reduced competition or even collusion, undermining the fairness and efficiency of the system.The dynamic reserve price mechanism acts as a defense against uncompetitive bidding scenarios. It is recommended to monitor the auction winners, their bids, and the MEV harvested over each round to ensure that the express lane does not become too profitable for auction winners.Introducing MEV strategies not currently viableOrdinary transactions will remain private until executed under Timeboost, which typically prevents the express lane owner from front-running user transactions. However, transactions like liquidations and pre-committed orders, such as limit orders, are at risk of being front-run by the express lane auction winner.This occurs because the express lane owner has a latency advantage, allowing them to manage and execute these transactions with a higher likelihood of landing in their order of preference. While these same strategies are technically possible under FCFS, the probability of landing them is low enough to discourage them. It is unclear whether this will change under Timeboost to make these strategies more predictable.In this case, the owner of the express lane has the opportunity to capture value that is not currently available at the expense of liquidated (or limit order-placing) users and/or protocols. It should be noted that if this is the case then presumably the express lane will become more valuable, increasing DAO revenue.Example of potential Timeboost Ordering MEV on liquidation:The express lane owner identifies a liquidatable account on a perpetual futures protocol.The express lane operator maximizes their profit by executing a sandwich attack, taking advantage of their 200ms latency edge (or however Timeboost is configured). This predictability allows them to execute the liquidation unopposed and complete the sandwich strategy:They first sell a large number of perpetual contracts on the relevant market, driving the price lower by either consuming order book bids or impacting the protocol’s pricing inputs, such as open interest imbalance.They then liquidate the account, further pushing the price downward.Finally, they close their position by buying back the contracts at the now-lower price.As a result, users receive less collateral after the liquidation than they would have if the sandwich attack hadn’t occurred.Comparison with Current First-Come, First-Serve Transaction Flow:An account becomes eligible for liquidation.Liquidators compete by spamming the network to execute the liquidation and claim the liquidation bonus.Due to the competitive nature of liquidation rights, liquidators cannot easily predict or front-run transactions.While this results in network spamming, the liquidations remain efficient.Careful monitoring of express lane transactions should be sufficient at this stage as it is unclear whether Timeboost provides sufficient advantage to the express lane controller to execute harmful strategies. Keeping the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter shorter than block times could also be a useful mitigant in this regard.Friction to the adoption of limit order books on Arbitrum Orbit ChainsIntroducing a 200ms latency could render fully on-chain limit order books impractical in the future from a market maker UX perspective. Market makers rely on low latency to cancel orders promptly, and the delay would increase the potential for by the express lane controller to trade on their stale prices before they are able to cancel them, putting market makers at a significant disadvantage.Considering the predominant DEX designs currently this is unlikely to be an issue on Arbitrum One or Nova, but application-specific Orbit Chains considering this might need to consider how this risk.Market making on limit order booksOn limit order book exchanges, there are typically an order of magnitude more cancelled orders than matched trades. The SEC reports that there are 14 cancelled orders for every matched trade in US stock markets. The reasons for this phenomenon are explored in more detail here and are found to be primarily driven by adverse selection risks.Under Timeboost, when an arbitrageur controls the express lane, as we expect it to be much of the time, market makers are disadvantaged in the latency they experience relative to the arbitrageur. As a result, their stale prices would be vulnerable to arbitrage before they have the opportunity to cancel or update their orders.This can be tangibly explained with the following example. Imagine market maker XYZ in the ETH market submits a bid at 2499 and an ask at 2501, in line with the best bid and ask on CEXs. Then imagine the external price on these CEXs quickly changes to 2504 bid, 2506 ask. The arbitrageur will, with certainty, buy from XYZ on Arbitrum and sell on a CEX, putting XYZ into a short position off-market.While this risk exists with the current first-come-first-serve transaction ordering, arbitrageurs do not receive favorable treatment. Instead, the arbitrageurs will likely spam the network to compete against each other and the price-maker for the arbitrage opportunity. Under Timeboost, arbitrage is more likely, and market makers will have no option other than to widen their spreads as a result.ConclusionsWhile the ultimate impact of the Timeboost upgrade on the microstructure of time-sensitive transactions on Arbitrum is impossible to completely predict ahead of time, Chaos Labs finds the economic risks acceptable.We recommend closely monitoring the time sensitivities in and out of the express lane to ensure sufficient competition remains to mitigate abuse of the privilege in hard-to-predict ways. We also recommend monitoring to ensure that it does not lead to the enablement of cross-domain MEV, which could begin to harm users.Chaos Labs has performed an economic risk audit of the Timeboost upgrade and finds no material blockers to implementation.

Because Arbitrum’s Sequencer is “first come, first serve” and fully open, anyone that sees an opportunity to make a profit can send a transaction to realize the gain. The trouble is that a lot of these opportunities become visible to the entire market at the same time, incentivizing all market actors to send a transaction to the network in the hope that they’re first. The first motivation for this AIP is to address spikes in network traffic that have caused the Sequencer to go down in the past. This AIP works toward smoothing out the spikes by removing the incentive for everyone to send transactions to the market. It removes this incentive by creating an auction for the right to jump the transaction line for a period of time (one minute is suggested). If someone has the right to jump in front of you, there’s no incentive to race to be first. This ties into a second described motivation for the AIP: by auctioning this right, the DAO can be compensated for providing these financial opportunities in the first place. The auction and it’s surrounding infrastructure is designed by Offchain Labs, with Espresso Systems collaborating, and is called “Timeboost.”ReviewThis AIP is in it’s theoretical phase. There is no code or decentralized version today, but community approval would grant Offchain Labs and Espresso Systems the runway to develop those things. Those details are where most of our security concerns will be so we look forward to reviewing their work when it’s available. The auction mechanics are sound and use well-understood methods. The roles in the system and their responsibilities are well separated and as simple as can be. We have no security concerns about the centralized version of Timeboost as it is described in this AIP."

The change only involves a modification of an existing configuration parameter and does not introduce any new functionality.OverviewThe Arbitrum DAO has a governance process whereby the community can vote on proposals fully on-chain. Two distinct kinds of proposals can be passed: those that spend funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH treasury and those that perform upgrades to the contracts governing the system. In either case, there is currently a 3-day delay between the time a proposal has passed and when it is executed. While the same delay applies for both types of proposal, the former is governed by the L2 Treasury Time Lock while the latter is governed by the L2 Core Time Lock. As such, the delays for each proposal type are independent and any changes made to one will not necessarily impact the other.While these delays are in place, the Security Council can always step in to stop malicious proposals. However, the delay gives the Security Council the time to act in the event that a malicious proposal is indeed passed. In addition, it provides users the opportunity to withdraw their assets in the event that they are dissatisfied with the changes that would result from a proposal. The proposal would increase the delay applied to the L2 Core Time Lock from 3 days to 8 days. All proposals regarding spending funds from the ArbitrumDAO ETH treasury would still maintain a delay of 3 days. Only constitutional proposals related to smart contract upgrades would be affected.MotivationThe primary motivation for this change is to increase the aforementioned security benefits. Namely, an increased delay will give the Security Council more time to review and stop malicious proposals (which is already a technical and lengthy process), while also providing users more time to make an informed decision. Furthermore, the proposal mentions a framework developed by L2BEAT as part of the motivation behind it. More specifically, it will change the color of Arbitrum’s ‘Exit Window’ slice on L2BEAT’s Risk Rosette from red to yellow.By only increasing the delay on the L2 Core Time Lock, a compromise is achieved between security and speed. Since constitutional proposals are much more complex in nature, the Security Council requires more time to review these proposals than those directed towards the treasury. This timelock delay increase would provide the necessary time to review these potentially complex proposals while the traditional proposals regarding treasury spending adhere to the existing process. The downside of increasing this delay is that constitutional proposals will now take an extra 5 days to execute. No additional costs or security risks are introduced to the system as the proposed changes only modify one configuration parameter.Technical DetailsNo new functionality needs to be introduced for this change. The value of the existing _minDelay parameter would be changed from 259200 to 691200 in the L2 Timelock contract. Note that the units of this parameter are in seconds, so the change is from 3 days to 8 days as explained earlier. The action contract has already been implemented and is pending an audit. It consists of a contract that has a function called perform which:Calls the L2AddressRegistry contract deployed on Arbitrum at 0x56C4E9Eb6c63aCDD19AeC2b1a00e4f0d7aBda9d3 to get the value of the coreGovTimelock state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at 0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0.Calls the updateDelay() function of the stored coreGovTimelock contract with the new value of 86400 * 8. Note that 86400 is 24 hours in seconds, so this would effectively update the delay to 8 days as described. This function, in turn, sets the _arbMinDelay to this new value and emits an event. No other changes occur.Using the same coreGovTimelock contract, the getMinDelay() function is called to ensure that the new value of _arbMinDelay reflects the proposed change.Calls the L2Registry contract once again, this time retrieving the value of the arbitrumDAOConstitution state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at 0x1D62fFeB72e4c360CcBbacf7c965153b00260417.Calls the setConstitutionHash function with the new value of 0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938. This reflects the changes made to the constitution text which are discussed further below. This function, in turn, sets the constitutionHash state variable and emits an event. No other changes occur.Using the same arbitrumDAOConstitution contract, the constitutionHash() getter for this state variable is called to ensure that the new value of constitutionHash reflects this change.The CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction contract already seems to have been deployed on the Arbitrum network at 0x5B947D8bF197467be7ef381b7cAfEE0A7B35737A.The current constitution of the Arbitrum DAO has been modified with the following changes:- Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.+ Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.- Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.+ Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.A keccak256 hash of the full constitution text was used to generate the value mentioned above. Based on independent review from the ARDC, these changes have been verified to produce the same hash as mentioned by the team. This can be verified by following the same instructions for generating the hash as outlined by the team, with the new changes to the constitution reflected. Note that the CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction contract has not been directly audited and any calls are not guaranteed to succeed. However, the functionality would only execute if the changes are successfully performed. In addition, no other changes are proposed beyond those explicitly mentioned in the proposal.ConclusionWe found the timelock delay increase proposal to be a reasonable compromise between increased security and maintaining the existing benefits of speedy treasury proposals. This will enable Arbitrum to transition into a more mature rollup that operates independently of any centralized actors, as outlined by the L2BEAT framework. Moreover, the proposal provides added security to reduce the possibility of malicious contract upgrades being executed, while also increasing the amount of time a user has to act on a proposal. The changes described in the proposal have been verified and exactly match those that are currently pending execution on-chain."

We will also compare it with other mechanisms like Optimism’s Priority Gas Auction (PGA), FastLane, and OEV Network proposed by API3. We will examine how these transaction ordering policies influence value capture at both the application and base layers.As highlighted by Flashbots’ research on L2 MEV, there has been over $3.9 Bn and $400 Mn in MEV volume across atomic arbitrages and sandwich attacks, respectively, across major Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Scroll, and OP Stack-based rollups. Understanding how this value is generated and who captures it is crucial in further designing and optimizing networks.31280×430 40 KBTransaction ordering policies are a critical aspect of network design, as they directly affect value capture, incentives, and strategies employed by third parties such as searchers. For instance, low-fee networks are vulnerable to spam and DDoS attacks, and the way transactions are ordered impacts how quickly they are processed.Currently, Arbitrum chains use a First Come, First Serve (FCFS) transaction ordering system at the sequencer level. However, a new proposal under consideration by ArbitrumDAO suggests that Arbitrum One and Nova should adopt Timeboost. In contrast, Optimism uses a modified Priority Gas Auction model based on EIP-1559, while FastLane is employed within Polygon’s ecosystem. API3’s  OEV Network is specifically designed for Oracle-reliant transactions like liquidations.In the sections that follow, we will delve into these transaction ordering mechanisms and assess their potential impact on value capture.TimeboostTimeboost is a newly proposed transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum chains. It aims to capture all available MEV for the chain owner while protecting users from harmful types of MEV behavior without sacrificing UX (by preserving fast block times and not adding further delays).First Come, First Serve Transaction Ordering PolicyArbitrum chains currently order transactions on a First Come First Serve (FCFS) basis. Transactions are sequenced into blocks based on their order of arrival at the sequencer. In this case, MEV opportunities, like arbitrage, are captured by those whose transactions reach the sequencer the first. So, profiting from MEV opportunities usually boils down to winning a latency race. To reduce latency, competitive searchers spend heavily on building low-latency infrastructure and trying to co-locate their systems closer to Arbitrum One’s and Arbitrum Nova’s sequencer.With FCFS, transactions are included as and when they arrive, ensuring fast block times, up to 100ms. Additionally, without a public mempool-like structure, negative symptoms of MEV, like frontrunning and sandwich attacks, are eliminated. This is in contrast to what is seen on Ethereum Mainnet, where negative symptoms of MEV from Sandwich attacks is multiple times higher than MEV from arbitrage.4773×474 30.5 KBSince the sequencing of transactions depends on the chronological order in which they arrive, searchers are incentivized to spam to improve the odds of their transaction being sequenced first. This is also a common MEV strategy known as back-running. This is a problem in low-fee chains because spam strains the chain’s infrastructure and contributes to congestion.While FCFS is a simple and straightforward ordering policy that reduces harmful MEV while preserving fast block times, FCFS contributes to spam on the network, which can result in congestion and strain on the network. Additionally, under FCFS, searchers are able to capture most, if not all, of the MEV in opportunities they identify and act on, leaving none for regular users, projects, and the DAO.How Does Timeboost Make a Difference?Timeboost introduces an auction where participants can bid for faster transaction inclusion in a dedicated ""express lane”. By default, the auction winner gets a 200ms time advantage for transaction inclusion over other transactions. So, with Timeboost, to win a MEV opportunity over other participants, searchers have to bid the highest to access the express lane to be first or use better strategies on alpha before others can even identify them. This shifts the competition from pure latency to a prediction & bidding process. All the proceeds from the auctions go to the ArbitrumDAO (in the current proposal). The ArbitrumDAO then has the authority and flexibility to choose how the funds are spent.With Timeboost, transactions on Arbitrum can follow two paths. One is the Express lane, where the express lane controller (winner of the auction) can submit their transactions and receive no delay in their transaction being sequenced. Normal transactions submitted outside the express lane will experience a 200ms (default) time delay for transaction inclusion. The express lane controller can also endorse transactions sent by others with express lane treatment.  This would be possible as express lane transactions arrive at a separate RPC endpoint exposed by the sequencer.11272×709 62.3 KBAuction Set-upAuction ContractThe funds used by a prospective auction participant to place bids are deposited into this contract on L2. Given that Timeboost runs a sealed-bid second-price auction, it collects the 2nd highest bid from the highest bidder.Autonomous auctioneerThis off-chain server collects bids from all auction participants and submits the top two bids to the auction contract on-chain, at most 15 seconds before the next round.The auction winner will then control the express lane for the next round. During the round that the auction winner controls the express lane, they, or any entity they designate control to, will have a 200 ms advantage over other transactions for a duration of 1 minute. Searchers who have this advantage can capture MEV in two main ways. Arbitrage (CEX-DEX or DEX-DEX) and backrunning (liquidations). These two types of MEV do not harm users, unlike sandwich attacks and frontrunning.Auctions are held and resolved every minute to determine the controller of the express lane for the following minute. The auctioneer accepts bids in the first 45 seconds and may take an additional 15 seconds to resolve. The winner or the current Express Lane license owner will have a 200 ms advantage for 1 minute.Auction participants in Timeboost have to make a deposit to bid. The minimum bid amount is set at 3 ARB or 0.001 ETH, depending on which asset the DAO chooses to implement. There is also a limit on how many times a bidder can place bids each round. Currently, this limit is set at 5 bids each round per-address. This helps prevent bidders from excessively spamming the auctioneer contract and performing a DDoS attack.Auction DynamicsWinners could make use of the express lane in the following ways.Given that Timeboost hosts ahead-of-time auctions, there are two components of MEV capture. One is based on predictions of future MEV opportunities; another is by identifying and capturing MEV in real-time when in control of the express lane.Competitive searchers can build price prediction models that would allow them to predict  the size of MEV opportunities up to 15s into the future in scenarios like CEX-DEX arbitrage and liquidations. With this prediction, these searchers can decide whether to participate in the auction for express lane control & can choose how much to bid. It is important to note that the transactions are not publicly visible in a mempool, given that transactions on Arbitrum chains are directly sent to the sequencer. With FCFS, searchers would have to be the fastest and engage in spam to be the first to capture MEV as it arises. With the Timeboost, the express lane controller has a 200ms time advantage to be first, improving their chances of capturing profitable MEV opportunities that they predict.Another strategy could be to continually try and win express lane control over longer periods of time, even at a short-term loss, and then re-sell those rights to other market participants for a long-term gain/profit. This is basically a secondary market for express lane rights.Express lane controllers may also share their lanes with other parties. This is likely in scenarios where both parties stand to gain the most when the opportunity is shared (MEV gained from sharing > MEV extracted alone).Value AccrualAuction proceeds are sent to Arbitrum DAO’s treasury. The use of the proceeds is up to the DAO to be determined. Proceeds from the auction can be collected in either ETH or ARB within the Arbitrum Treasury. This decision is up to the DAO to collectively make.FastLaneFastLane builds smart contracts and infrastructure that allow validators, apps, oracles, and wallets to capture MEV. One of their designs is used by validators to order transactions on the Polygon network. To set some context, Polygon also faced transaction spam issues. Transactions on Polygon follow two paths: direct and announced. In the direct path, transactions are directly propagated to a pre-determined number of validators and have a 500ms advantage over transactions in the announced path, where transactions are broadcasted in Polygon’s validator network. This path can be slower because most validators are not peered, i.e., not connected through a p2p network. Instead, they are connected through a set of sentry nodes that listen to transactions and then propagate them to validators.Sentries were placed to prevent DDoS attacks by controlling the flow of transactions to validators, but they also ended up being a bottleneck, causing delays. So why is spam here an issue? Transactions are randomly sent through either the direct or announced path. So, to be first and capture MEV opportunities, searchers have to spam transactions to increase their chances of being sent first through the direct path.FastLane helped reduce transaction spam and increased validator revenue.PFL Nodes: These modified Polygon nodes act as intermediaries between searchers and participating validators. They connect to other PFL nodes, creating a dedicated network for transaction bundle propagation.Validators opt into the FastLane on Polygon by peering their nodes with at least one PFL node and modifying their existing sentry nodes to prevent random direct propagation of transactions. This ensures that all transactions intended for the FastLane system go through the PFL nodes and the auction mechanism.PFL Auction Contract: The contract manages auctions for transaction ordering. Searchers submit bids through this contract to win priority ordering. The contract optimistically executes the searcher’s transaction and then reverts it if the searcher’s bid is not paid in full by the end. This allows validators to sort transactions by bid amount without relying on simulations. If the bids aren’t paid in full, the MEV opportunity will be made available for the next bidder.21280×716 55.5 KBAuction Set-upFastLane uses Priority Gas Auctions to order transactions. Searchers using FastLane can have their bundles included over other transactions with a 500ms advantage. Searcher bundles are ordered based on their bid value. The higher the bid, the higher the priority.  Unlike Timeboost, Bidders on FastLane are not required to place any deposits to bid. This can make it easier for bad actors to spam bids to congest the auction and cause delays. This is a problem faced by many low-fee chains. Additionally, there is no one single winner in FastLane auctions. Priority ordering is given based on bid size to several participants.Auction DynamicsFastLane runs an English auction where bids are visible to other bidders. But the auctions last randomly until the bids are propagated to the auctioneer. While searchers may see each other’s bids, it doesn’t mean they can view all bids in the auction and form their strategy around it, as they can’t rely on a +1 bidding strategy. The random auction duration adds this uncertainty to the process. Unlike Timeboost, there is no base bidding price. Bidding values can vary based on the amount of MEV that stands to be captured at any given moment.Given that bundles are prioritized based on bid value and Polygon runs a public mempool, FastLane is open to capturing all MEV opportunities, good and bad. Searchers can capture any real-time MEV opportunity, given that the FastLane runs in real-time. When an auction is in real-time, the winner of the auction can make use of the opportunity right after being rewarded. Searchers do not have to predict MEV opportunities in the future and place bids based on expected revenue that may have complications & uncertainty involved.Value AccrualAll the proceeds collected through FastLane auctions go to Polygon validators. On the other hand, Atlas helps capture MEV on the app layer, but it is out of scope for this post as it is concerned with L2 transaction ordering policies. FastLane & Atlas are mutually exclusive solutions and don’t require the other to operate.Optimism’s Priority Gas Auctions (EIP-1559)Optimism and, consequently, Base, which is based on OP Stack, use Priority Gas Auctions based on EIP 1559. OP Mainnet uses a private mempool, so OP Bedrock will be using a public mempool.Optimism’s PGA uses priority ordering based on the bid size, similar to FastLane. It runs an English auction where bids are visible to other bidders. This can lead to bidders changing their strategies based on the bids they observe. Certain strategies rely on spamming bids to overwhelm the auctioneer. This is especially problematic in low-fee chains as spam becomes an issue unless preventive measures such as deposits are in place or if there are any limits on the minimum and maximum number of bids that each participant can place.EIP-1559 doesn’t change the amount of blockspace supplied, so it should not change the level of fees (keeping the demand equal). If the spam results from users not knowing how much to bid precisely, EIP-1559 provides a clear price that users must pay to have an inclusion guarantee.But suppose the spam is caused by sophisticated actors who want to get their MEV transactions included and are involved in a priority gas auction against other sophisticated actors. In that case, 1559 is unlikely to help.Value accrual dynamics here are similar to FastLane’s, which also runs a priority gas auction. Much of the capture MEV would flow to the auctioneer (sequencer in this case), and some would be left with searchers.OEV NetworkAPI3’s OEV Network is designed explicitly to capture MEV from liquidations. It is not a generalized transaction ordering policy like Timeboost & FastLane. Individual lending protocols can integrate with the OEV Network while the rest of the chain continues to use its own ordering mechanism. OEV Network operates as an Arbitrum Orbit chain whose sole purpose is to host auctions to capture OEV. In our report here, we have detailed how the OEV Network operates and compared it with similar solutions.OEV Network auctions off the right to use an Oracle price update. This ensures that only the winning bidder can successfully liquidate a position. This contrasts block space auctions between searchers and block builders on Ethereum, where competing searchers lose ~80-90% of their liquidation revenue to block builders in the form of bribes to have their OEV transaction included.OEV Network ArchitecturedAPIs/Oracles – API3’s dAPIs are data feeds from first-party sources operated by the data providers.Auctioneer Node – OEV Network auctions are conducted by the Auctioneer Node. The auctioneer node is responsible for selecting and announcing the winning bidder.Bonding Contract - Bidders must deposit collateral on OEV Network in binding contracts to place bids. The collateral is set to be about 10% of their bid.51280×714 58.8 KBAuction Set-upTo participate in OEV Network auctions, liquidators bridge ETH to OEV Network to create a deposit. This amount will be used to place bids in auctions.The winning searcher then performs liquidations on the respective chain where the opportunity was present. To complete the liquidation, the searcher performs an atomic transaction in which it executes the Oracle price update, extracts OEV, and pays the bids. To ensure that searchers pay their bids when the data feed is updated, the bid amount will be included in the meta transaction utilizing the signature all the Oracle nodes added individually. This way, searchers must pay their bids to use the price update to capture OEV.Initially, OEV Network will also operate using an English auction and later transition to a First-Price Sealed-bid Auction (FPBSA) that is fully on-chain. Bidders submit their bids to the auctioneer in an encrypted format in this auction. Searchers would be unable to learn who their competitors are and how much they are bidding, preventing the drastic increase in the number of bids that will be placed on the chain. Only the auctioneer is allowed to view bidder identities and their bids. Once the auctioneer has viewed the encrypted bid values, the highest-paying bidder will be chosen as the winner. This also ensures that searcher bidding strategies are hidden.Value AccrualLiquidations are a competitive “short-tail” MEV strategy. Searchers engage in intense bidding wars in these auctions, using their war chest capital or flash loans to outbid one another. Consequently, despite capturing substantial value (OEV), searchers pay or bribe off over 80-90% of their revenue to block builders and validators to have their MEV transaction successfully included.61785×728 160 KBWith OEV Network, auctions are held at the oracle level instead of the block builder level. This way, all the auction proceeds are captured by the OEV Network and shared with the lending protocol related to the liquidation.ConclusionAs stated above, auction designs heavily influence value capture and user experience. Timeboost, Optimism’s PGA, FastLane, and MEV-Boost are all down-stream auction designs where the auctioneer captures bid proceeds and from where the value flows to the validators or to the chain. OEV Network, on the other hand, is an auction held more upstream at the oracle level. Unlike other designs where the implementation is at the chain level, OEV Network requires integrations from individual lending protocols. Each integrated lending protocol can get a share in the auction proceeds.Sharing extracted value with the originators of order flow, i.e., users and protocols, should be an essential consideration for most of these designs.Even with the addition of Timeboost, Arbitrum can still maintain a maximum of 450 ms block time. It protects users from front-running and sandwich attacks as Arbitrum operates with a private mempool. Users sending their transactions to an Express lane controller would have to trust not to be front-run or sandwiched. To this end, a reputation system could be established to moderate Express lane controllers. Bid proceeds from Timeboost are directed to Arbitrum DAO’s treasury as revenue.71175×658 43.2 KBIt is important to note that most, if not all, of the parameters of each of the designs above, can be calibrated based on historical data and predictions that may improve the design’s performance and sustainability. On 09/05/2024, Arbitrum updated their Timeboost proposal to include granting the sequencer operator the ability to make changes to the duration of delay, max bids, and minimum bid price and also to have the ability to disable Timeboost in case of an emergency or to respond to market conditions for the duration of 2 years.ResourcesArbitrum’s TimeboostTimeboost Design specConstitutional AIP: Proposal to adopt Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policyFastLanehttps://www.FastLane.xyz/PFL_WHITE_PAPER_1_5.pdfOEV NetworkDelphi DigitalAPI3: The State of OEV - Delphi DigitalOver $3.1 billion have been liquidated on lending protocols on Ethereum, but these liquidation mechanisms are not the most efficient.

Both Governors currently are proxy contracts which share an implementation contract but have slightly different parameters to enable their constitutional/non-constitutional functionality. The deployment scripts in scope deploy two new proxy contracts with the new L2ArbitrumGovernorV2 implementation. With these deployed, a proposal to switch to the new governors needs to create a call to the respective timelocks to remove the old governor’s proposer and canceller roles and add those roles for the new governors. Of course, this proposal needs to take its usual path of going from the L2 timelock, to the L1 timelock, and finally to the L2 executor which can make upgrade calls on the L2 timelock.The changes to the governor contract were not drastic. L2ArbitrumGovernorV2, now allows proposers to cancel their proposal if it is pending. It also allows a new, fractional vote to be cast in proposal votes. Previously, a voter’s entire voting power had to go to a single option. With fractional voting, anyone can split their votes between options or not cast their votes with their entire voting power. We anticipate this to be very beneficial for contracts with delegated voting power that can now split their votes according to their own logic. The new governor uses updated, prerelease versions of the OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.1 library. Because of this, there are some new functions exposed on the new governor:cancel is the new function proposers can use to cancel their pending proposalCLOCK_MODE & clock provide the contract’s clock data as described in EIP-6372eip712Domain describes the domain separator that is used for verification of EIP-712 signatures (see EIP-5267)nonces will return the next nonce for a user. Useful for users/contracts who castVoteBySig.proposalNeedsQueuing simply lets any caller know that proposals need to be queued before execution (i.e. it always returns true)proposalProposer returns the proposer for any proposal idusedVotes returns the voting power already cast for a proposal by a contract. This is useful now that users can split their voting power.Trust AssumptionsThe deployment scripts rely on Foundry to sign transactions and we assume that it works as intended and described.Low SeverityProxy Contract Initialization Should Be Done In One StepWithin BaseGovernorDeployer.sol, the deployment of the proxy and its initialization is done in two steps. Foundry will create transactions for each of these steps, meaning a determined actor could front-run the initialization step and render the deployment ineffective. The remedy would be to simply re-attempt the creation/initialization of these contracts. But to remove this risk entirely, consider encoding the initialize call as the _data parameter in the TransparentUpgradeableProxy constructor. The _data will be passed down to _upgradeToAndCall where it is used in a delegate call on the new implementation contract.Update: Resolved in PR #23 at commit a4dd5ffFloating PragmaPragma directives should be fixed to clearly identify the Solidity version with which the contracts will be compiled.The GovernorCountingFractionalUpgradeable.sol file has the solidity ^0.8.20 floating pragma directive.Consider using fixed pragma directives.Update: Resolved in PR #26 at commit 8813043Notes & Additional InformationProposal Description Could Be More DescriptiveWithin SubmitUpgradeProposalScript.s.sol, the proposal to change the governor is described as “Upgrade timelock roles”. Consider making the change of governors part of the description.Update: Resolved in PR #28 at commit 918b32cMissing DocstringsThroughout the codebase, there are multiple code instances that do not have docstrings. Consider thoroughly documenting all functions (and their parameters) in both the L2ArbitrumGovernorV2 and TimelockRolesUpgrader contracts. Functions implementing sensitive functionality, even if not public, should be clearly documented as well. When writing docstrings, consider following the Ethereum Natural Specification Format (NatSpec).Update: Resolved in PR #29 at commit 1b26d60Lack of Security ContactProviding a specific security contact (such as an email or ENS name) within a smart contract significantly simplifies the process for individuals to communicate if they identify a vulnerability in the code. This practice is quite beneficial as it permits the code owners to dictate the communication channel for vulnerability disclosure, eliminating the risk of miscommunication or failure to report due to a lack of knowledge on how to do so. In addition, if the contract incorporates third-party libraries and a bug surfaces in those, it becomes easier for their maintainers to contact the appropriate person about the problem and provide mitigation instructions.Throughout the codebase, there are contracts that do not have a security contact:The GovernorCountingFractionalUpgradeable abstract contract.The L2ArbitrumGovernorV2 contract.The TimelockRolesUpgrader contract.Consider adding a NatSpec comment containing a security contact above each contract definition. Using the @custom:security-contact convention is recommended as it has been adopted by the OpenZeppelin Wizard and the ethereum-lists.Update: Resolved in PR #31 at commit 766226bMissing Named Parameters in MappingsSince Solidity 0.8.18, developers can utilize named parameters in mappings. This means mappings can take the form of mapping(KeyType KeyName? => ValueType ValueName?). This updated syntax provides a more transparent representation of a mapping’s purpose.Within GovernorCountingFractionalUpgradeable.sol, there are multiple mappings without named parameters:The usedVotes state variable.The _proposalVotes state variable.Consider adding named parameters to mappings in order to improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase.Update: Resolved in PR #27 at commit 79d4c31Unnecessary CastsWithin TimelockRolesUpgrader.sol, there are two instances where address is cast to address:The address(_governor) cast.The address(_governor) cast.To improve the overall clarity, intent, and readability of the codebase, consider removing these casts.Update: Resolved in PR #24 at commit 5cfb15cTypographical ImprovementsThere are a few minor typographical errors in a comment block of L2ArbitrumGovernorV2. These areLine 40: “addresses” should be “address”.Line 41: “address” should be “addresses”.Line 43: “of” should be “or”.Consider fixing these for better readability.Update: Resolved in PR #25 at commit 1d77696Client ReportedNew Registry Contract Is NecessaryCurrent governance action contracts (GACs) rely on an L2AddressRegistry contract to provide data and check for correct implementations. Consider creating a deployment script for a new registry contract with the new governor address.ConclusionDuring this engagement we reviewed a new version of Arbitrum’s governance contract, which now allows voters to split votes and proposers to cancel their own pending proposals. Along with the contracts, we reviewed the scripts that are going to be used for deploying said contracts and those that will be used for proposing the relevant role changes on the respective time lock contracts. We found the codebase to be of high quality and have only found Low and Note severity issues. We found the test suite to be comprehensive and well written."

We updated the timeline accordingly.AbstractOpenZeppelin, as the Security Member of the ARDC, recommends the following timeline and plan for the Rollout of the Arbitrum Governance Upgrade, based on the recommendations of ScopeLift, to prevent new proposal submissions during key stages of the Upgrade.We propose a detailed timeline of the anticipated Upgrade Rollout and information on the current and new Governor contacts, including key periods for when each set of contracts should be utilized for the submission of new proposals.BackgroundThe Governance Upgrade has been funded by a proposal from Tally and the upgrade implementation by ScopeLift has already been reviewed by OpenZeppelin to ensure it is secure. ScopeLift has since shared the finalized contract code and migration scripts which have been available for the community to review for the past two weeks.As ScopeLift moves forward to propose the upgrade, it’s important to ensure that the Arbitrum community is aware of the need for a moratorium on new proposals during the early stages of the upgrade process. This is due to the fact that the upgrade is being performed by migrating both the Treasury and Core Governor contracts to new smart contracts, rather than performing a proxy upgrade. ScopeLift has specifically stated:We recommend that once this proposal is onchain, no new proposals are created until after it passes… (or fails, of course). If a proposal were to be created during this time, it would likely get stuck and have to be resubmitted to the corresponding new Governor.Our initial Rollout Plan included a proposal moratorium period of several weeks that would require delegates to abstain from submitting new proposals during key stages of the upgrade. However, Offchain Labs has since proposed the following solution:One alternative could be to use an 10 day L1 Timelock delay in this proposal, this would bring the round trip time to 20 days, just above the max voting period. That way the existing governor could still be used for proposing until the voting period of this proposal ended, if the proposal passed then users would now start using the new governor, if it failed they would continue using the old one.After all parties reviewed this solution, ScopeLift has stated that they will now include the additional 10 day Timelock delay in their proposal, which removes the need for a proposal moratorium. However, it still important for delegate to have clear expectations for when and where new proposals can be submitted during the Upgrade Rollout.Upgrade Rollout TimelineGiven the requirement for a proposal moratorium while the Upgrade is pending, it’s important that all governance participants are made aware of each stage of the Upgrade Rollout. As such, we recommend all delegates review and understand the following stages of the upgrade timeline below. Please note that some dates are estimates due to the potential for small extensions or delays in the governance process.On Sept 9th: An Upgrade Proposal will be submitted to upgrade Arbitrum governance through a migration to the new Governor contracts.Sept 9th to Sept 26th: The Upgrade Proposal will go through a 3-day review period followed by a 14-day vote.Sept 26th to Oct 16th: Assuming the Upgrade Proposal has passed, it will be pending execution, taking its usual path of going from the L2 Timelock, to the L1 Timelock, and finally to the L2 Executor which can make upgrade calls on the L2 Timelock. This includes an additional 10 delay added. During this time, DAO infrastructure tools, such as Tally, should begin the process of migrating to use the new Governor contracts targeted in the Upgrade, while still preserving the history of prior proposals from the old Governor contracts. This will ensure that all new proposals submitted on-chain by delegates will default to the new Governor contracts.Oct 16th: The Upgrade Proposal will be executed with a call to the respective timelocks to remove the old Governor’s proposer and canceller roles and add those roles for the new Governors. This will complete the upgrade with new governance contracts having the role permissions necessary to execute any proposals submitted prior.Proposal Submission PeriodsGiven the upgrade timeline, there will need to be a clear set of time periods when proposals can submitted to the current legacy Governor contracts and new Governor contacts. With the additional 10-day time delay on the Upgrade Proposal, it should be feasible for the current legacy contracts to be utilize for proposal submissions up until the end of the Upgrade Proposal vote. Once the vote is completed and successful, all future proposals should be submitted to the new Governor contracts. This plan allows proposals to be submitted throughout the Upgrade Rollout timeline with only the minor risk that proposals submitted to the new Governor contracts are disrupted by an unforeseen issue with the execution of the Upgrade Proposal.Given this new setup, we propose a Legacy Governor Submission Period followed by a New Governor Submission Period to determine where and when new proposals should be submitted:Legacy Governor Proposal Period (Sept 9th to Sept 16th): Proposals should only be submitted to the CURRENT LEGACY Governor contracts during this period. This is already the current status quo for how Arbitrum DAO proposals are submitted and will last up until the end of the voting period of the Upgrade Proposal.Preliminary New Governor Proposal Period (Sept 26th to Oct 16th): Proposals may be submitted to only the NEW Arbitrum Governor contracts between the end of the Voting Period (assuming the Upgrade Proposal has passed) and the Upgrade execution. Any proposals submitted during this time take the risk of an issue in the Upgrade execution disrupting their proposal, although that risk is minimal and will simply require the proposal to be resubmitted later. Tally (@frisson) has committed to migrating their platform to the new Governor contracts during this period so that proposals can be submitted with minimal friction.Governor Contract AddressesScopeLift has already deployed the new governance contracts that will be utilized in the Governance Upgrade. We include information on both the current legacy contracts and new contracts for everyone’s reference during the Upgrade Rollout.Current Legacy ContractsCore Governor: 0xf07DeD9dC292157749B6Fd268E37DF6EA38395B9Treasury Governor: 0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4New ContractsCore Governor: 0x7796F378B3c56ceD57350B938561D8c52256456bTreasury Governor: 0x4fd1216c8b5E72b22785169Ae5C1e8f3b30C19E4Please ensure you use the Current Legacy Contracts for any proposal submissions prior to the Upgrade Proposal and the New Contracts after the Proposal Moratorium has passed. Tally will be performing this migration on their platform and so is the preferred choice for making submissions during this period to avoid confusion.Impact on Security Council ElectionsAs first identified by Offchain LAbs, this Governance Upgrade DOES NOT include the Security Council Governors (SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor , SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor and SecurityCouncilMemberRemovalGovernor). Voters using flexible voting will not be able to take part in Security Council elections by default. The ScopeLift and Tally teams have indicated they are aware of the limitation and have plans to propose additional upgrades in the future to address this concern. We recommend that they propose a plan to roll this upgrade out before the March 2025 Security Council elections begin.Security Council elections for the next cohort will begin on Sept 15th with final voting starting on Oct 13th. Given the lack of impact on the Security Council Governors and the fact that the Upgrade Proposal will not be executed until Oct 16th, there should be no direct disruption to the Security Council voting process. We do recommend that Arbitrum delegates first cast their votes in the October Security Council election before making use of the new Flexible Voting feature.ConclusionWe trust this forum post will provide all Arbitrum delegates the information needed to understand the impact of the impending governance upgrade. We specifically ask that all delegates ensure they understand and agree to adhere to the following recommendations:If you have an on-chain proposal to submit in the near future, please review the Proposal Submission Periods and be aware of the time periods at which to utilize the current legacy Governor contracts (up until Sept 26th) or new Governor contracts (after Sept 26th).If you wish to submit a proposal during the Preliminary New Governor Proposal Period (Sept 26th to Oct 16th), please ensure that you understand and accept the potential risks, however minor. We highly recommend waiting until Tally has confirmed completion of their migration to the new Governor contracts before submitting proposals during this period.Once the Upgrade Rollout is complete, ensure that you only use the new Governor contracts for all proposal submissions going forward.If you wish to make use of the new Flexible Voting feature following the Governance Upgrade, please be aware that it will prevent you from being able to vote in Security Council Elections while in use. Please cast your votes for the Security Council elections starting on Oct 13th before making use of the Flexible Voting feature.This Upgrade Rollout plan has been developed in cooperation with ScopeLift, Tally, Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation for which we greatly appreciate their support. If there any questions or concerns regarding this Upgrade Rollout and our recommendations to the community, we welcome feedback in the forum below.We will monitor and provide updates on the upgrade process as it occurs in the forum, including any potential changes to the estimated timeline.

Two sources actively earn fees (Sequencer, Orbit), while one is still in production and pending governance approval (Timeboost).This part of the report intends to provide the Arbitrum community with a detailed breakdown of the DAO’s current income.SequencerThe Arbitrum sequencer is currently generating the DAO the highest percentage of its income. The sequencer generates income by collecting the delta between gas fees paid by users and the Ethereum settlement cost. This delta has grown significantly since the launch of EIP-4844, which significantly reduced L1 settlement fees.However, the ArbOS Atlas upgrade reduced the L1 surplus fee to 0 gwei and the minimum L2 base fee to 0.01 gwei (a 10x reduction). This has lowered the gas fees users pay to improve their user experience, but it has also lowered the DAO’s net profit.arbitrum_sequencer_revenue,_expenses_decline_post-dencun (1)1920×1080 211 KBArbitrum’s sequencer has generated $123M in revenue from transactions and ~$40M in profit after L1 settlement fees. In the 12 months leading up to EIP-4844, Arbitrum’s Sequencer generated $21.6M profit. Since EIP-4844’s arrival in March, Arbitrum’s sequencer has generated $10M, representing an annualized pace of $25M. The arrival of blobs have drastically reduced both revenue and expenses for rollups. Arbitrum’s profit margin is much improved, but its $10M profit in the first 5 months after 4844 is significantly propped up by outlier events. In the week of June 17, Arbitrum earned $3.5M profit, benefitting from an uptick in activity during the LayerZero TGE.These outlier events are difficult to forecast, and perhaps give an overly optimistic outlook on Arbitrum Sequencer profit, but these one-off events are commonplace in crypto and will continue to occur.Orbit ChainsArbitrum Orbit chains are L3s. They generate income through the revenue-sharing model that Orbit chains pay if they choose not to settle on Arbitrum One or Nova. The fees are currently 10% total: 8% to the DAO and 2% to the developer’s guild.base_profits_dominate_rollup_landscape (1)1920×1080 205 KBThis is a similar relationship to that of Base <> Optimism, in which Base shares 15% of profits or 2.5% of sequencer fees (whichever is greater). Base has generated more revenue and market share than Optimism itself. In theory, Arbitrum Orbit’s ecosystem can be expected to surpass Arbitrum One once it gets going.Recently, the DAO approved the deployment of Orbit chains to settle on chains besides Ethereum or Arbitrum One/Nova. This can be an important revenue stream for the DAO because this revenue is sticky.Once a chain is deployed, it is obligated to send 10% of revenue to the Arbitrum DAO forever. Revenue can be exponential here if the number of Orbit chains deployed continues to increase.base_leads_rollup_profit,_demonstrates_bull_case_for_orbit_11920×1080 237 KBBase generated $51M profit in year 1, with ~$6.4M going to Optimism. If the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem generates Base-tier profits, Arbitrum DAO would see about $3.3M annually. Base is in a league of its own and assuming any Orbit chain alone will achieve Base’s traction is naive. Arbitrum’s strategy with Orbit is geared more towards attracting a multitude of different projects to launch L3s. Zora network is a more intuitive comparable for Orbit chains early on. If Arbitrum succeeds in kickstarting a vibrant ecosystem of Orbit chains, they could potentially rival base profits in aggregate.TimeboostTimeboost is a transaction ordering policy proposed by the Arbitrum Foundation. It enables auctions to reward winners with transaction advantages. This is beneficial for the DAO as it effectively takes a solid percentage of the MEV that bots are generating and collects it as revenue for the DAO. These auctions can be paid in ETH or ARB. Until production, it is not viable to forecast revenue from Timeboost, as stated in the proposal.Revenue Outlook2024-08-21 19.32.50720×405 23.8 KBArbitrum will likely be the first L2 to share real yield with stakers, and this tangible claim on future growth could offer a powerful narrative boost. Assuming 50% of profit is distributed to stakers and a 75% stake rate, staking would generate 0.93% APR.ARB DAO Spending1920×1080 222 KBAs discussed in the expenses section, ARB has weathered its biggest unlock event but significant unlocks and DAO spending will hit the market over the next few years, doubling ARB’s circulating supply.Arbitrum’s expenses and unlock schedule create a difficult climate for ARB holders. Roughly 6M ARB per month will hit the market through DAO expenses, and 92M ARB/month will come from team and investor unlocks. This is a total of 1.2B ARB per year, not including any additional DAO spending. This represents 36% of ARB’s 3.3B circulating supply and $700M in annual sell pressure at ARB’s current price of $0.57.Becoming the first L2 token to share revenue with stakers will be a powerful narrative and sentiment booster, but is likely inadequate to mitigate the unlock climate. Supplementing the real yield with treasury ARB is likely necessary to act as a shield for supply dilution.The most difficult aspect of this exercise will be finding the optimal amount of ARB to offset ARB dilution. Dedicating treasury resources to improving the token holder climate offers concrete benefits to the DAO; it offers a more sustainable habitat for long-term holders and prevents the need to liquidate ARB to front-run unlocks. This will support ARB price and mitigate the issue of decreasing ARB price and reduced purchasing power for DAO spending.2.9B ARB are remaining of team and investor unlocks. Theoretically, Arbitrum could dedicate almost the entirety of its 3.1B treasury ARB to offset ARB unlocks. This exaggerated example would deplete over 90% of treasury ARB resources, but it’s a helpful way to frame the optimization problem that faces the DAO. In order to improve sentiment around the ARB token, a material portion of the ARB treasury will be necessary. In addition, providing clarity around the timing and use of future DAO spend could prevent the market from lumping it in with unlocks.Staking ProgramThe Arbitrum Staking program should be designed to incentivize delegation while also ensuring delegates are active, as the DAO suffers from a lack of participation amongst delegates. We believe rewarding delegates who are active in governance is the best approach. However, systems currently in place do this but have not been successful in ensuring delegates’ votes.Users’ stake’ their ARB by delegating to themselves or a third-party delegate.Rewards can be distributed in weekly epochs with a split of 90:10 between delegators and delegates.If a delegate fails to vote on all of the proposals that week, they and their delegates should not receive ARB rewards for that week. This incentivizes active delegation and ensures delegators are careful whom they delegate their ARB to.The program should be incentivized with X% of the Sequencer, Orbit fees, and Timeboost revenue.Currently, the Timeboost proposal offers two options for the proceeds of the revenue generated:Collect the proceeds in ETH and send them to the DAO.Collect the proceeds in ARB and send them to the burn address.We propose a third option: collect the proceeds in ARB and distribute to stakers.Burning the ARB collected from Timeboost misaligns incentives between long-term and short-term ARB holders. Instead of reducing the ARB supply, the DAO should focus on putting ARB tokens in the hands of holders who are aligned with Arbitrum’s long-term mission. This is likely to be the holders delegating and the delegates.The revenue generated from the sequencer and Orbit fees is not consequential enough to justify being the only sources of revenue directed to the staking program. Therefore, we believe it is in the best interest of the DAO to direct Timeboost revenue to the staking program as well.All revenue should either be collected as ARB or ETH and swapped into ARB to distribute to stakers.This is because distributing as a buyback will be net positive for ARB’s price performance and help reduce regulatory risks associated with distributing in-kind.Supplementary reward approachesStandard, flat - A standard X ARB distributed to stakers over X months approach is safe, easily digestible, and potentially effective. ARB staking rewards from the DAO partially offset ARB unlocks. ARB stakers effectively maintain a greater portion of their share of total network ownership than non-stakers and receive tangible upside in network traction through real yield. The risk with this approach is that it is not sufficiently differentiated from other models. With at least 1.2B /year hitting the market, Arbitrum may not want to dedicate a large amount of ARB to offset 25% of the unlocks for the market to just not care because the situation is still suboptimal.Linear decay - A front-loaded strategy offers a no-nonsense approach to the current ARB price action and provides a path to sunsetting for real yield. This approach would somewhat mirror Optimism’s approach, whereby RPGF rounds are funded with OP, before tapering off in favor of sequencer fees.For example, 20% of treasury ARB (60M) is dedicated to the program, with 35M in the first year, 15M in year 2, and 10M in year 3. ARB rewards would materially offset dilution immediately, tapering off while real yield increases.One drawback of this approach is ARB hitting circulating supply accelerates in the short term. However, holding ARB will become much more attractive for long-term stakeholders.Linear growth - Yet another option could involve scaling up ARB emissions as more ARB hit the market. This would allow ARB staking rewards to keep pace with an expanding circulating supply in the months to come. The issue here is that ARB staking will be resource-intensive later on when, ideally, alternative income streams are up and running. ARB staking will also be less impactful on a token-for-token basis.Key Takeaway:Standard flat, safe option for supplementary ARB rewards may be the best fit if the DAO is willing to dedicate a substantial portion of the treasury (25-30%) to the staking program over the next few years. If the DAO prefers to spend less on the staking program, the linear decay approach may work better in order to allow for strategy on behalf of the user to make the opportunity worthwhile. Using a front loaded 15% of treasury arb for staking rewards could give similar benefits to the prior option in the short run.Arbitrum should seriously consider a strong investment into the supplementary staking rewards. Prior snapshot concluded 100M (3%) of the budget, more of the unlocks. Holding ARB is unattractive, and this dynamic has harmful repercussions to DAO operations and in the community. Arbitrum has a healthy supply of ARB in the treasury, and should consider deploying it while it is most effective."

If enacted, the proposal execution will register a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract that will migrate the RARI DAO from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The new token contract has been fully audited and deployed to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and all contracts have been manually tested.OverviewThe $RARI token that is used to govern the RARI DAO is currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradeable. However, the RARI DAO would like to upgrade its governance to allow for new features to be implemented such as snapshots and delegations. By bringing its governance to the Arbitrum ecosystem, RARI DAO would also improve the user experience through lower gas fees and increased accessibility of their system. Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.Custom Gateway MotivationThe Arbitrum chain allows for tokens to be bridged between various networks, such as between Arbitrum and Ethereum. In the case of many ERC-20 tokens, this involves associating a token contract on some other chain with a paired token contract on Arbitrum. When users wish to bridge their tokens, the tokens are escrowed in a bridge contract on the host chain, and an equal amount of tokens is minted on Arbitrum. Using StandardERC20Gateway, any ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet can be permissionlessly bridged to Arbitrum by default. However, this standard approach is not suitable for some tokens. For example, tokens accruing interest need to ensure that the rewards are dispersed properly to other chains instead of just being accrued to the bridge contract. A custom gateway system allows for specialized cross-chain asset bridging in such exceptional cases where additional bridging logic is necessary to be implemented.The Arbitrum generic-custom gateway is designed as a flexible solution that is suitable for most custom needs beyond what is available using StandardERC20Gateway. In the case of the new $RARI token, the proposed changes include the addition of snapshotting and delegation functions, as well as the introduction of proxy-based upgradeability. According to the Arbitrum Foundation documentation, this is likely the right solution for such a migration since these changes are limited in scope (as opposed to the addition of minting functionality directly on Arbitrum, for example).Technical DetailsIn order to register the new $RARI token to the custom gateway, the relevant steps are outlined by the Arbitrum Foundation.Deploy your token on ArbitrumThe new $RARI token deployed on Arbitrum should conform to the IArbToken interface, as in the following example implementation.Register your token on L1 to your token on L2 via the L1CustomGateway contractThe $RARI token currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to L1CustomGateway.registerTokenToL2. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.Register your token on L1 to the L1Gateway routerFinally, the $RARI token deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to L1GatewayRouter.setGateway. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.The RARI DAO has already voted in favor of a proposal that would deploy the custom $RARI token on Arbitrum, ensuring the completion of the first action item. The RARI DAO is now requesting registration to the L1CustomGateway and L1GatewayRouter contracts via this governance proposal. The mapping between the tokens deployed on the mainnet and the Arbitrum chain would then be updated and the RARI token would be registered to the generic-custom gateway, completing the remaining two steps in the registration process.The upgraded token contract from the proposal has also been fully audited.ConclusionThe proposed changes, including registration of a new $RARI token to the generic-custom gateway, are appropriate to meet the needs of the RARI DAO. Since the currently deployed contracts are non-upgradeable and the RARI DAO wishes to add new features to their token, as well as enhance user experience, this operation is necessary. Using the standard ERC-20 gateway would not support the new desired enhancements and the changes do not require a unique, tailor-made gateway. Registering with the generic-custom gateway is a good fit for this transition."

This proposal aims to increase participation and delegation in the ARB ecosystem, by implementing liquid staked ARB.Arbitrum DAO voter participation has been steadily declining post launch. With the recent attempted/successful attacks on other large DAO’s (Compound, etc.), ARB governance is currently at risk of incurring a governance attack, which puts the DAO’s $2b+ treasury at risk. If enacted, this proposal will create a mechanism for ARB holders to stake their tokens into Tally Protocol’s liquid staked ARB token (tARB, recently renamed stARB) to incentivize users participating in governance. This would assist in mending the current issues by creating a financial utility that will stream rewards in the future for holders that are actively participating. To measure such participation, the staking contracts will integrate with Karma, which will keep track of each users Karma Score. Karma Scores will be calculated based on a given users forum activity score, off-chain, and on-chain voting participation. The DAO will define this score requirement for a user to be considered an active delegate, and has rights to block Karma scores, if the score is deemed invalid.We now share our findings and recommendations below to help improve the security of the design and to better inform Arbitrum delegates on the potential risks that should be carefully considered before moving forward.Review SummaryIntegration Risks With Tally Protocol LSTTally will create the ARB Staking and tARB token contracts to be integrated into the existing DAO platform. The Initial staking contract supports Uniswap’s Unistaker and Tally Staker. Tally Staker extends upon Unistaker to be customized for Arbitrum’s governance architecture and fee collection mechanism.  Such features will include delegate compensation along with a way to add arbitrary fee sources as rewards. Refer to Tally’s introduction article for a more in-depth overview of the protocol.There are always some risks associated with adding new integrations to an existing protocol. This will increase complexity for the DAO while creating a wider attack surface for malicious actors. It should also be noted that the Tally Protocol LST is a new type of offering to the market and could even have unforeseen risks in the future. Such possibilities are unknown currently due to not having more implementation details or source code. This makes it hard for both the community and our team to further evaluate potential integration risks.The event in which the tally protocol ever turns awry, a malicious actor could:Take full control of the staking contractsSteal or temporary/permanent freeze other user fundsManipulate the LST prices in their favoretc.All examples would give the malicious actor the ability to then attempt a governance takeover. These may be prevented from an audit however, any that slip through would leave the DAO at risk.Recommendation:We recommend that extra precautions should be put in place to help protect the DAO if such event were to happen. It would help in easing any damage to the DAO that could occur due to an attack upon the Tally Protocol. This also goes for any future Integration with other Arbitrum staking systems that could be developed.General Risks That Come With LSTsAs mentioned above the integration with Tally protocol LSTs adds another layer of complexity to the DAO system. This is due in part to the LST token itself, again broadening the attack surface of the DAO at large. On top of this, an LST tokens value does not always reflect the value of the underlying staked assets. This sort of risk can lead to potential price discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities. It becomes highly possible that during a downturn in the market that the price of the LST token could fall below the price of the underlying asset, potentially incurring a loss for the token holders at the maturity of the staked assets, subsequently damaging the DAO itself. Lastly, upon the initial launch of the LST there will be liquidity risk due to fragmented/limited liquidity in both primary and secondary markets. It should be noted that there is the potential for unfavorable price movements.Recommendation:Our recommendation here is again to proceed with caution when moving forward with this proposal. For example, referencing Delphi-Digital response, were as the ARB supply grows and if the quorum increases too quickly w/ token supply. The same issue could arise all over again leading to people not being incentivized to stake/delegate. Moreover, An increase in complexity and attack surface for the DAO opens it up to new ways of being attacked. In addition, with the volatile price movements of LSTs extra care should be taken with launching to help prevent any risks that come with it. This could include, thoroughly fork testing different market scenarios such as initial launch, during a market downturn,  etc. Proper market monitoring should be put in place to alert the community to take action if needed. While also ensuring the entire protocol be subjected to a security audit.ConclusionWe have provided several important security recommendations here that we encourage to carefully consider to enhance the security stance of the system. We are impressed with the level of thoroughness from the Arbitrum community discussing the potential risks of the proposal. We have also highlighted several risks and concerns that Arbitrum delegators should consider in their decisions regarding this proposal. We are more then happy to further discussions and questions in the forum.For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our Notion homepage."

St","SummaryFor consideration by Abitrum DAO’s delegates and voters, OpenZeppelin presents an overview of staking options, the risks they each have, and possible ways the DAO could stake its ETH reserves.  If the DAO decides to stake, we recommend gradual investment into a regularly-rebalanced, diversified portfolio of LSTs actively managed in a DAO Treasury Management Vault to minimize trust and mitigate centralization while enabling adaptability to changing risk tolerance and market conditions.Staking OverviewStaking ETH is part of the proof-of-stake process for Ethereum mainnet. Stakers are allowed to propose/validate specific, new blocks and attest to a correct path through the block tree building a canonical block chain as it goes. If a staker does not attest to a block at the right time they will lose part of their staked funds. Doing everything correctly currently gains stakers about 3% of their stake per year, making staking yield less than US treasuries but more attractive than just holding ETH in a wallet.Staking, however, does have some interesting systemic concerns. For example, an entity that controls 33% of all staked ETH can delay finality which some have compared to holding finality hostage. An entity that controls 50% can begin to manipulate block chain fork choice and censor a small amount of blocks. An entity that controls 66% cannot forge transactions but otherwise completely controls what transactions occur on the network. They can censor and reorder transactions at will (including even halting finality). This allows them to dictate the rules of the mempool and have a powerful voice for their future vision of the network. Lido (discussed below) has flirted with the 33% threshold in the past and there are serious concerns that centralized exchanges could amass a concerning amount as well. The concentration of ETH is something that should be monitored regularly by the community. The worst-case scenario is that individual entities would be incentivized to create a cartel and reach the larger, more powerful thresholds that no one member of the cartel can reach on their own. Users aware of this possibility can counteract it by diversifying what entities they stake with. Self-staking would be one way to implement such a strategy and would contribute to the decentralization of the network.Staking OptionsSelf-StakingSelf-staking is when users stake their own ETH by running their own validator node. This allows users to have full control over their funds so that they are able to withdraw their stake when and where they choose while also contributing to the decentralization of the network. The tradeoff for more control, though, is more responsibility. Should a user’s hardware go offline and the node not be present when they are required, they will be penalized the rewards amount they would have made. Worse, if a node makes a serious mistake (like proposing two different blocks) then they will lose a significant portion of their staked amount. The Ethereum Foundation documents the necessary validator software for a node so getting started should be quite easy.Key ConsiderationsRunning a node requires mitigations of the operational risksHardware Failure: hardware failing would create downtime for the node and penaltiesWhat redundancy solutions are in place?DDoS attacks: the node being down could cost you penaltiesAre you implementing methods to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks?Node Software Bugs: The software running the node could have bugs causing the node to have bad behavior and be penalized. The worst case scenario can occur when a super majority of all clients run the same node software implementation. A bug in this case could mean all these nodes reaching finality on incorrect blocks and getting slashed on the chain that did not encounter the bug.What execution client is running? consensus client? Are they part of a super majority of clients being run?What will the software be running on? Is it reliable?Web2 Attack vectors: A node machine connected to the internet could receive malware. Worst case scenario is the heist of the node’s private keys. Vitalik cited this as the reason for him not staking his entire ETH amount.Are you following good security practices?Who has access to the machine and what powers do they have?Mitigation of these risks usually requires utilizing battle-tested resources and practices. The good news is that spinning up a node and a secure plan for its operation can take place on the Holesky testnet. Users should spend time assessing their node setup and effectiveness on this testnet prior to moving to mainnet.Staking As A ServiceStaking-as-a-service (SaaS or sometimes StaaS) allows users to outsource the running of the validator node to a hired operator. There are two large distinctions here: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial SaaS means delivering complete control of your funds to an entity who promises to stake and reward in a certain way but users have no control over their funds, the entity’s behavior, and the regulatory regime of the entity. Examples of this are centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. Not only can the exchange’s regulatory regime change haphazardly and without warning, but the exchange itself also has its own security practices which may or may not be disclosed or correct and many numerous exchanges have lost user funds.Non-custodial Saas includes services like Kiln and Stakefish. Users deposit their ETH with the provider who then runs the node for them. The node will have its own signing keys and allows the user to have their own, private fund keys which allow them to move funds in and out of the node. In this way, users will have more control over their funds but as determined by the staking provider.Key ConsiderationsUtilizing a provider requires trust and verifying their system’s behavior. Vetting a SaaS provider means determining how much of their operation is programmatic and transparent and also measuring their operational history against their operational risk management practices.Transparency Allows Trust: black-box SaaS providers have no ability to convince users of their practices and guarantees.What parts of the system are open source? audited? bug bounties?How are critical components like keys and funds handled?What fees do they charge? How is this verifiable?Best Practices Are Best: providers that have plans for mitigating the operational issues above demonstrate competence. Look for providers that are open and proactive at describing the risks within their systems and how they handle them.How long has the provider been operating?How much have they experienced penalties over their operation? What for? Have they ever been slashed?Do they describe mitigations to the operational risks described above?Keep Things Permissionless: if a system is permissionless to enter and exit, then malicious operators and regulatory regimes cannot interfere with user funds.Is it permissionless to join?Is there a regulatory regime that affects the provider? Does it require Know-Your-Customer information to join?What keys are required to be handed over? Are there separate keys for signing and moving funds?Good vetting goes a long way but ultimately SaaS requires trust. Diversification among many different, qualified providers could protect a user from concentrated bad effects if there are enough trusted providers to be found.Pooled StakingPooled staking is when users deposit their funds together for a node operator to utilize and share staking rewards. Pools that are largely managed on-chain are the most common and provide smart contracts for users to manage their participation. Less common are SaaS-like pools where fund management and rewards are handled off-chain to some degree. By far the most common on-chain solution is for pools to provide ERC20-compliant liquid staking tokens (LSTs) for user deposits. This provides a unique opportunity for users. First, it’s incredibly convenient. A simple deposit is often enough to begin. And second, these pools allow users to stake but then re-deploy their LSTs to other financial purposes. In this way, users can stake and then gain further returns on their capital. Posting these tokens as collateral for more ETH and then repeating the staking process is not uncommon and allows users to create leveraged, staked positions but exposes them to the risks of market prices moving drastically against them and swallowing their initial staking capital. Examples of staking pools include Rocket Pool and of course Lido which is the single largest staked ETH holder.Key ConsiderationsStaking pools have similar risks to SaaS providers but must also handle commingled funds across possibly multiple node operators. As mentioned above, Lido is the giant in this space and its operation is handled by the Lido DAO. So responsible users of the protocol should keep themselves apprised of the DAO’s initiatives and votes. Also, the systemic concerns begin appearing here as well. Lido has been criticized for not doing enough to counter its profit-seeking motivation and the power of the market incentives for cartel-like behavior cannot be dismissed. Lastly and perhaps most difficult to measure, the ability of users to easily create large leveraged positions could create a catastrophic financial contagion scenario in the face of a large transaction or price movement. For example, June 2022’s stEth depeg was the catalyst for the bankruptcy of Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital.Systemic Risks: Users should be cognizant of the health of the network and play a responsible part. Diversification among different pools can help mitigate centralization risks.How much staked ETH does the pool own?How many node operators does it employ? How are these node operators chosen? Are there policies in place to limit incentives for collusion?Market Risks: Liquid staking tokens allow users the opportunity to re-deploy their capital but that means they’re subject to the market moving against them.Does it provide a liquid staking token? Does it swap for ETH one for one or by an oracle?How well does the LST price track the price of ETH through time? What is its market history? Are there other market factors that can be seen to influence the price of the LST? Has it ever depegged?What financial analyses are available to assess the financial status and risks of the LST? of its penetration into other markets? of its use in leveraged positions?Will you be re-investing your LSTs and putting your ETH stake at risk?Pool-specific Operational Risks: DAOs (malicious or not) could enact bad upgrades, switch infrastructures, or mandate new policies within an ecosystem that was assumed to behave a different way by users. Commingling of funds also presents a new difficult task with its own risks.What components are on-chain and off-chain? How are they controlled? What is the governance structure?Is there an operating DAO? Is it dominated by a few actors? What are its goals, initiatives, and vote history? Has it defined a philosophy toward its role and services?How do funds enter and exit the pool? How are they then staked and unstaked?RestakingIn addition to Ethereum’s proof of stake process, there are other processes called Actively Validated Services (AVSs) which also require staked assets to operate. Restaking is the practice of using ETH or liquid staking tokens to stake on AVSs. They can be oracles, bridges, cryptography schemes, etc. An example of a restaking protocol is Eigenlayer and examples of AVSs are Lagrange and Gasp. Usually, restaking providers give ERC20-compliant liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) for deposits and these have similar risks to LSTs in the market. This is a relatively newer service and does have slightly higher returns than the above options but at higher risk of losing funds due to the added complexity of running these services. These are much more complicated than liquid staking pools and are utilized by many to lever up a position and get the highest possible return from a staking-based strategy. Leverage among LRTs, like leverage of LSTs, complicates markets in ways that are difficult to quantify and investigate.Key ConsiderationsRestaking has all the complexity of liquid staking pools and then more. Restaking’s complexity and the less-developed markets for their tokens create serious risks that may not be worth it for an investor like Arbitrum DAO where safety of the funds is prioritized.Considerations for the DAOAll of the above describe staking risks but not their prevalence. As staking operations and markets become more mature, these risks become less and less likely. So how should the DAO proceed?Determining a StrategyIn the future, when issues arise and theses no longer hold true, having a written-down investment plan helps justify the path taken and determine what will need to be done next. The DAO should commit to defining:What their staking and investment goals areWhat is the timeframe of their staking/investingOf the risks described above, what are they willing to take on and how muchAs we’ve seen from discussions, the staking goals of the DAO appear to be to protect against ETH inflation, to generate revenue from the ETH reserves they hold, and to do all of this as safely as possible. Whether the DAO has specific, future liabilities they are working towards, we are not aware but these should be part of the investment plan if they exist. The time frame appears to be indefinite, i.e. it seems that this may be a permanent use of the ETH reserves. As for risks, the DAO should determine what risks it likes and what it doesn’t.Risk Assessment and DiversificationLet’s start a risk assessment by stating that individual staking may be operationally infeasible for a DAO to run. Multi-sigs, payment agreements, and all sorts of logistics can be set up, but the DAO would ultimately have to trust someone to handle the hardware, software, and funds correctly. So all the set up work is effectively the same as staking via with a SaaS provider but with extra, time-intensive steps to begin. This means that there is no option where the DAO stakes without trusting someone. Put another way, to stake the DAO will have to reasonably trust another party with their funds.We also do not go into much detail about Restaking and risks and leave it to the DAO to make that determination if they so choose. LRTs are easier to depeg and markets are harder to analyze therefore we’d recommend the DAO consider LSTs and build experience in these services before considering LRTs.This leaves SaaS and Staking Pools. From an operational risk and security perspective, there are SaaS providers and Staking Pools with histories of security and good practices. Each will need to be vetted as described above but the general difference between the two are the market forces that act on pools’ liquid staking tokens. Whether to accept market risks is for the DAO to decide. But having worked in the DeFi space, we see that good investment practice is to document the LST’s market forces, the possible blind spots, the market history, have a plan of action that is ready and easy to implement in case certain conditions arise, visit the assumptions and theses of the plan regularly, and to change the plan if the DAOs understanding of things changes.To protect itself from catastrophic, operational failure, OpenZeppelin will vet the security and posture of the different options the DAO considers. The DAO could also split its staked ETH across different options, limiting the max amount they can lose in the worst case scenario. The DAO can also consider slowly staking its ETH over time as it grows comfortable with the different options and strategy as a whole.Strategy ExecutionA DAO treasury management protocol like Aera can be used for securing a diverse portfolio of assets, not limited to the recommended LSTs, with programmatically constrained active management.  A solution like this allows the DAO to remain in control of treasury funds and respond to market conditions faster than a governance vote.Links and Referenceshttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982https://ethereum.org/en/staking/https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.mdhttps://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guideshttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4840805https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-basehttps://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/"

If enacted, the proposal execution will activate Stylus, Alternate Signature Verification, and Automatic Treasury Deposits using seven on-chain governance action contracts (GACs) that alter the ecosystem in the ways described in the proposal description. The new, on-chain contracts match their audited versions with the exception of the contracts in the OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts for fund distribution which we read but did not audit.OverviewThis proposal does three separate things.StylusSmart contracts are computer programs. They execute the code they store and the code that Arbitrum has used until now has been Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code. Different computer languages like Solidity and Vyper can be stored as EVM code but more popular languages like Rust or C++ cannot. They can, however, be stored as Web Assembly (WASM) code. This proposal will upgrade the on-chain contracts to allow not only EVM but also WASM code to be executed on Arbitrum One and Nova chains. Allowing WASM would mean that these more popular languages can be used by the developers who know them and don’t want to learn an EVM language.Alternate Signature VerificationEthereum and Arbitrum are secured by cryptography. Because a user’s keys are effectively impossible to figure out, they can use these keys to “sign” transactions and everyone knows that only they could be the ones that signed it. There are many different key-signature schemes including the popular secp256r1. This scheme is widely used by numerous web services and most notably by Apple and Android devices. To be able to easily use this scheme on-chain would make dApps easier to integrate into these platforms. This proposal cuts the cost of using secp256r1 signatures down drastically (up to 99%) by creating a “precompile” or special program that will perform the signature verification in the node and not in the EVM. This node software is the ArbOS referred to in the proposal.Automatic Treasury DepositsArbitrum DAO collects fees for transactions on the Arbitrum networks. Currently the fees are sent to the L1 Timelock on Ethereum mainnet. The DAO’s treasury, however, sits on the Arbitrum One network. To collect the fees that come from Arbitrum Nova, a full vote must take place which requires at least two weeks to fully conduct. This proposal removes the need for these votes by creating fee routers which will transfer the funds across the networks to the DAO’s treasury automatically.Technical DetailsScopeWe reviewed the calldata as of commit 52c086 in Pull Request #298 for the proposal of ArbOS 31 “Bianca” that was recently proposed to the Arbitrum Core Governor.Our review included determining the proposed execution, what contracts are involved, and if the contracts have demonstrated credibility.Proposal ExecutionThe proposal stores a call to the ArbSys sendTxToL1 precompile which sends a transaction to L1. The cross- transaction (decoded calldata) targets the L1 Timelock’s scheduleBatch function and stores seven different calls to be executed of  two calls on L1, two on Arbitrum One, and three on Arbitrum Nova.L1 CallsThe two calls on Ethereum are to the L1 Upgrade Executor to delegatecall perform on two different governance action contracts (GACs). This follows the established protocol for upgrades in the ecosystem. The two GACs set a new challenge manager contract, initialize it with a new one-step-prover contract, and set a new WASM module root for the rollup contract. One GAC upgrades the contracts for Arbitrum One and the other upgrades the Arbitrum Nova contracts. We diffed the new contracts on-chain with the contracts found in the audited repos and found no differences. Our diff included all compilation artifacts and related contracts and not just the single contract with the matching name. We summarize this diff in the following table:Audit Report: ArbOS 30 Nitro UpgradeAudit Commit: de1852cAddressChainContract NameContracts CheckedDiff with Audit Commit0x914B7b3053B35B84A24df08D7c9ceBCaEA4E2948ETHChallengeManager24No diff0xa328BAF257A937b7934429a5d8458d98693C6FC7ETHOneStepProofEntry20No diffNote that while there are differences between the audit commit and the v2.0.0 commit, no differences exist in the contracts of interest here.We also want to note that although there is a guide for confirming the WASM module root, it is not the most user friendly. We recommend the guide be updated for community users not as experienced with the codebase and practices.Arbitrum One CallsThe L1 Timelock forwards two calls on to the Arb One delayed inbox, creating retryable tickets. These two calls target the Arbitrum One Upgrade Executor, again calling execute which delegatecalls to the perform function on two GACs. The first schedules the upgrade to the ArbOS version for 3 Sep 2024 @ 5pm GMT via the ArbOwner precompile. The second GAC adds the new cache manager to the ArbOS. We compared the cache manager’s implementation contract against its audited version and found no difference.Audit Report: ArbOS 30 Nitro UpgradeAudit Commit: de1852cAddressChainContract NameContracts CheckedDiff with Audit Commit0x7f6dbaed9905c3b01030d3ad5aa93846ecbbfa44Arb OneCacheManager9No diffNote that while there are differences between the audit commit and the v2.0.0 commit, no differences exist in the contracts of interest here.Arbitrum Nova CallsThe L1 timelock forwards three calls on to the Arb Nova delayed inbox, creating retryable tickets. They all target the Arbitrum Nova Upgrade Executor, again following the familiar path of execute targeting a GAC that is delegatecalled. The first and second GAC are almost identical to the two GACs executed on Arb One described above and perform the same actions. The third sets up the new fee routing to send fees to the DAO treasury on Arb One rather than to the L1 Timelock. There are five contracts it integrates:an L1 surplus fee distributoran L2 base fee distributoran L2 surplus fee distributora Nova to L1 Reward Routeran L1 to One Reward RouterThe first three are RewardDistributor contracts that match the code in the audit repo at the specified commit, but are actually not identified within the scope of the relevant audit report. The Arb-to-L1 fee router (ArbChildToParentRewardRouter) is also not in the audit report, but is an iteration of a file that was audited. The proposal authors have stated that the changes are optimizations. We recommend that the files and changes be described for the community in greater detail so that they can review and gain greater trust in their contents.AddressChainContract NameContracts CheckedDiff with Audit Commit0xbb7f4871ace3bb0fffb36a9c28d0987ddab0da3aArb NovaCacheManager9No diff0x509386DbF5C0BE6fd68Df97A05fdB375136c32DeArb NovaRewardDistributor4Not in audit report0x9fCB6F75D99029f28F6F4a1d277bae49c5CAC79fArb NovaRewardDistributor4Not in audit report0x3B68a689c929327224dBfCe31C1bf72Ffd2559CeArb NovaRewardDistributor4Not in audit report0x3B68a689c929327224dBfCe31C1bf72Ffd2559CeArb NovaArbChildToParentRewardRouter4Not in audit report0x40Cd7D713D7ae463f95cE5d342Ea6E7F5cF7C999ETHParentToChildRewardRouter14adds a safeApprove featureSummary of diff between audit commit and v1.0.1FileLines AddedLines Removedsrc/FeeRouter/ArbChildToParentRewardRouter.sol880src/FeeRouter/ChildToParentRewardRouter.sol1955src/FeeRouter/DistributionInterval.sol11src/FeeRouter/OpChildToParentRewardRouter.sol630src/FeeRouter/ParentToChildRewardRouter.sol64src/RewardDistributor.sol11src/Util.sol11ConclusionIn our review of the proposal we found the payload for the L1 Timelock to be the same between the block explorer, Tally (see “Raw”), and the Arbitrum Foundation’s repo. We found that the on-chain, forum, and Tally proposal descriptions are consistent and that the descriptions accurately describe the execution of the proposal on-chain. The proposal dispatches seven different execution paths which we simulated independently and found that each executed as intended and without reverting. We expect this proposal to execute correctly should it pass.Lastly, we found some involved contracts have been refactored and we were unable to confirm that the RewardDistributor contract was audited. We recommend that these contracts be described in detail for the community to gain trust in them."

This adjustment has the potential to significantly increase revenue, potentially bringing in hundreds of additional ETH per month to the DAO’s treasury.We propose forming a working group dedicated to examining and creating this proposal. Specifically, we would like to call on the ARDC member Chaos Labs to join us in this effort. The aim is to develop a detailed and executable proposal that can be swiftly implemented to maximize the benefits for the DAO while minimizing the potential pitfalls of higher fees. We would like Chaos to help with backtesting the potential impact to network use at different minimum base fee parameters (0.02 through 0.1 gwei) and giving suggestions.ReasoningRevenue Increase: By adjusting the minimum base fee variable, the DAO could increase its monthly revenue by hundreds of ETH.Timely Execution: Delays in addressing this issue could result in substantial missed revenue opportunities. The DAO is on tracks to spend 10s of million of ARB to incentivize activity over the coming months.Expertise: Involving Chaos Labs and the ARDC will ensure that the proposal is developed with the necessary expertise and precision, reducing the potential to negatively impact the ecosystem.We urge the ARDC and Chaos Labs to collaborate with us in this initiative. The goal is to expedite the process and present a robust proposal to the DAO as soon as possible."

Any deployment scripts, configurations, mock contracts, or tests were not reviewed.System OverviewA recent discussion about delegating more voting power to retail investors ended in the passing of a snapshot vote which aims to delegate $ARB 7,000,000 to eventhorizoncommunity.eth. This is an EOA that the Event Horizon (EH) organization will use to represent the voters from their platform. ARB users can only delegate their entire voting power to another address. So, in order to delegate a specific amount, a contract has been created that will have the amount transferred to it and then delegate its voting power to EH.The contract that EH provided to do this is a fork of a contract that was developed for Uniswap. It was privately audited by Trail of Bits and has a lot of functionality beyond the minimum needs of the ARB DAO. The top-level contract which the DAO will interact with is the FranchiserFactory contract. It is built to allow anyone to delegate their ERC-20 voting token, like ARB, to a delegatee. It does this by creating a Franchiser contract underneath that would mark the FranchiserFactory as the owner, hold the $ARB tokens from the caller, and call delegate on the token to transfer the voting power to the specified user (e.g., the EH EOA).When the DAO is ready to take back the funds, a call to recall will pull the tokens out of the Franchiser and return them. There are added methods to batch delegation and recalling which we do not anticipate the DAO will need in this specific case but could use if more delegations of this sort arise. The FranchiserFactory contract will create a Franchiser contract as needed for each unique delegator/delegatee pair, while each Franchiser is set up as a minimal proxy of a Franchiser implementation contract.Each Franchiser contract has to ability for the delegatee to subdelegate their delegated tokens to further subdelegatees. This creates a tree of Franchise contracts with the original delegator/delegatee Franchise contract at the head, each subdelegation from a delegatee at each child node, and the tokens being transferred down the tree to imbue voting power. The original delegatee can sub-delegate up to eight times with each of these sub-delegating up to four, then two, then one. Counting the maximum possible nodes in each level of the tree totals to (1) + (8) + (8 * 4) + (8 * 4 * 2) + (8 * 4 * 2) = 169 nodes. At each Franchiser contract in this tree, the delegatee can unsubdelegate and return all of the funds transferred down the tree to their own contract and restore their full voting power delegation. The recall method mentioned above does the same thing but returns all tokens from the tree to the original delegator.The scope also includes an optional FranchiserLens contract which contains view functions to get data from the Franchiser tree in flat formats. It is not necessary for the other contracts in scope but would give the DAO easy visibility into their delegation and any further subdeldegations.Security Model and Trust AssumptionsThis code relies on the OpenZeppelin Contracts library for cloning, checking for code size, and for set operations. It also relies on the Solmate library for ownership and transferring tokens. We assume these libraries work as described and intended and both have long on-chain history.Notes & Additional InformationUnused ImportThe import import {Franchiser} from ""../../Franchiser.sol""; imports unused alias Franchiser in IFranchiserEvents.sol.Consider removing or using any unused imports to improve the overall clarity and readability of the codebase.Update: Acknowledged with comment “we will leave the stylistic notes as is as there are no objections to functionality.”Unused Named Return VariableNamed return variables are a way to declare variables that are meant to be used within a function’s body for the purpose of being returned as that function’s output. They are an alternative to explicit in-line return statements.In FranchiserLens.sol, the delegation return variable for the getRootDelegation function is unused.Consider either using or removing any unused named return variables.Update: Acknowledged with comment “we will leave the stylistic notes as is as there are no objections to functionality.”Lack of EventsThe FranchiserFactory contract does not any emit events when new delegations are made or recalled.Consider emitting events in functions that change the state of delegations.Update: Acknowledged with comment “we will leave the stylistic notes as is as there are no objections to functionality.”Inconsistent Access ControlIn the Franchiser contract, subDelegate, subDelegateMany, unSubDelegate, and unSubDelegateMany will revert if called by anyone who is not the delegatee of the contract. However, subDelegateMany is the only function that is not marked as such and will revert upon an inner call to subDelegate.To improve code clarity, consider marking subDelegateMany with the onlyDelegatee modifier like the other delegatee-restricted functions.Update: Acknowledged with comment “we will leave the stylistic notes as is as there are no objections to functionality.”initialize SpecificityThe Franchiser contract has two functions called initialize. The first one has three parameters and is only directly called from the FranchiserFactory contract to create a top-level delegation of tokens. The second function wraps the first, has two parameters, and is only used to create subdelegations of tokens from existing Franchiser contracts.To improve code clarity and readability, consider naming the second initialize function more specifically (e.g., initializeSubFranchise).Update: Acknowledged with comment “we will leave the stylistic notes as is as there are no objections to functionality.”Maximum SubdelegateesThe code has been designed for generic delegation and subdelegation of tokens. If the FranchiserFactory contract is to be used solely for this one EH delegation, it is possible to change the INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES to one and make further subdelegations by EH impossible. This would ensure that they do not have the ability to further subdelegate to another actor who is not in the proposal but would make vote splitting by subdelegation impossible by EH (at least until fractional voting is brought to the governor).Of course, by delegating in the first place, the DAO is already trusting EH to behave as promised. Thus, further subdelegations being used maliciously to vote in other ways appears to be a minor risk that is mitigated by the ability to revoke the funds. However, revoking is a slow process that would require a vote to pass as the L2 Governor would be the original delegator. A way around it would be to transfer the funds directly to the security council and entrust them to create the subdelegation from the FranchiserFactory contract. We are not aware, however, of a precedent or authority for the council to behave this way.Possible ways to improve the code and tailor it specifically to Arbitrum’s needs would be to give the non-emergency security council the ability to recall the funds. This can be done by allowing the council to be specified at initial delegation and adding an ability for them to call the recall function. However, even then, a call to recall (even unSubDelegate) could be front-run to get in a last vote before losing voting power. A fix for this could be to add some sort of authorization method for the delegatee to vote only on approved votes, but this seems overly protective and operationally taxing to implement. No matter what the community chooses or how the contract iterates, we will review any on-chain proposal for construction/delegation and opine on its safety and features.Update: Resolved in commit 101d01d.ConclusionThis audit covered the Franchiser contracts provided by Event Horizon. They will allow the Arbitrum DAO to transfer a token through the FranchiserFactory to a Franchiser contract which will delegate its voting power to Event Horizon, allowing them to vote on proposals. The Franchiser contract, as audited, allows Event Horizon to further subdelegate their tokens. If the DAO is not interested in using this contract for further grants, we recommend the DAO remove this subdelegation ability from the contracts by setting the INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES constant to one.We found no security issues with the contracts and our notes contain only recommendations for coding practices. We welcome iteration on the contracts and will be reviewing any on-chain proposals involving them. We are grateful to the Event Horizon team for being responsive during the audit and for bringing a compelling use case to the DAO.For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our Notion homepage."

However, subDelegateMany is the only function that is not marked as such and will revert upon an inner call to subDelegate.To improve code clarity, consider marking subDelegateMany with the onlyDelegatee modifier like the other delegatee-restricted functions.Update: Acknowledged with comment “we will leave the stylistic notes as is as there are no objections to functionality.”initialize SpecificityThe Franchiser contract has two functions called initialize. The first one has three parameters and is only directly called from the FranchiserFactory contract to create a top-level delegation of tokens. The second function wraps the first, has two parameters, and is only used to create subdelegations of tokens from existing Franchiser contracts.To improve code clarity and readability, consider naming the second initialize function more specifically (e.g., initializeSubFranchise).Update: Acknowledged with comment “we will leave the stylistic notes as is as there are no objections to functionality.”Maximum SubdelegateesThe code has been designed for generic delegation and subdelegation of tokens. If the FranchiserFactory contract is to be used solely for this one EH delegation, it is possible to change the INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES to one and make further subdelegations by EH impossible. This would ensure that they do not have the ability to further subdelegate to another actor who is not in the proposal but would make vote splitting by subdelegation impossible by EH (at least until fractional voting is brought to the governor).Of course, by delegating in the first place, the DAO is already trusting EH to behave as promised. Thus, further subdelegations being used maliciously to vote in other ways appears to be a minor risk that is mitigated by the ability to revoke the funds. However, revoking is a slow process that would require a vote to pass as the L2 Governor would be the original delegator. A way around it would be to transfer the funds directly to the security council and entrust them to create the subdelegation from the FranchiserFactory contract. We are not aware, however, of a precedent or authority for the council to behave this way.Possible ways to improve the code and tailor it specifically to Arbitrum’s needs would be to give the non-emergency security council the ability to recall the funds. This can be done by allowing the council to be specified at initial delegation and adding an ability for them to call the recall function. However, even then, a call to recall (even unSubDelegate) could be front-run to get in a last vote before losing voting power. A fix for this could be to add some sort of authorization method for the delegatee to vote only on approved votes, but this seems overly protective and operationally taxing to implement. No matter what the community chooses or how the contract iterates, we will review any on-chain proposal for construction/delegation and opine on its safety and features.Update: Resolved in commit 101d01d.ConclusionThis audit covered the Franchiser contracts provided by Event Horizon. They will allow the Arbitrum DAO to transfer a token through the FranchiserFactory to a Franchiser contract which will delegate it’s voting power to Event Horizon, allowing them to vote in proposals. The Franchiser contract as audited allows Event Horizon to further subdelegate their tokens. If the DAO is not interested in using this contract for further grants, we recommend the DAO remove this subdelegation ability from the contracts by setting the INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES constant to one. We also found no security issues with the contracts and our notes contain only recommendations for coding practices. We welcome iteration on the contracts and will be auditing any changes and on-chain proposals involving them. We are grateful to the Event Horizon team for being responsive during the audit and for bringing a compelling use case to the DAO."

This post focuses on aggregating the learnings from these case studies into a consolidated review to help delegates and protocols improve their decision-making in the future.The post starts with a risk analysis of the program on these protocols. It then examines the efficiency of incentive spending, offering actionable insights from case studies to form recommended best practices. This leads to a discussion of incentive elements that should ideally be included in future programs.The original analyses can be found here:Vertex ProtocolSilo FinancePendle FinanceRisk Footprint of the STIP programOverall, there is little evidence that the STIP program contributed to an increase in adverse outcomes manifesting due to the risks introduced. The potential risks identified, such as protocol bad debt, cascading liquidations, overleveraged activity causing price wicks, etc., did not occur during the program.However, the absence of adverse outcomes does not mean that the program did not alter the risk profile of the Arbitrum ecosystem.  Risk management must acknowledge that there is always a distribution of potential outcomes, and we need to contain the worst possible outcomes to maintain long-term stability.We believe that the starting point of the program coming in a bear market with little appetite for leverage or experimentation by users allowed for the dramatic but safe growth on Vertex Protocol, Silo Finance, and Pendle Finance as these protocols went from being under-utilized to a reasonable level of utilization.  This does not mean that similar risk outcomes would likely be observed should this growth start from a higher level.Chaos Labs recommends that the Arbitrum DAO stay vigilant, particularly where exposures are leveraged and composed of multiple protocol dependencies. To help ensure that risk management remains part of decision-making at all times, it is recommended to add a risk section to future incentive program application forms. This section should ask protocols to explicitly declare potential risks, cross-ecosystem dependencies and integrations, and a plan for mitigating these over the program.Productive Incentive AttributesAll three of the case studies examined grew their activity by multiple orders of magnitude, compared with an average TVL growth of 9.2% by STIP recipients. This presents us with many clear, actionable incentive strategies and tactics from the program for the Arbitrum DAO to learn from.Experiment and Iterate: Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way.  This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2.  The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning.  There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple: Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements: This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.Avoid Incentivizing Mercenary Behavior: Wash trading, sybils, and other inorganic activity is solely the result of incentives rewarding such activity and these strategies will be unwound as soon as the incentives end. There is no long-term benefit to incentives spent on these strategies as they are not retained after the program ends. Legitimate strategies earn fewer rewards as a result, and the program impact is diluted.  There was limited evidence of this in the case studies as activity was mainly subject to a small positive fee.Use Incentives to Increase Integrations and Composability: Incentivizing the end use case was a powerful growth driver for growing the ecosystem of a protocol.Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand: Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium.  This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal.  This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.Maintain Momentum with Native Incentives: If feasible, it is advisable to maintain momentum in the most impactful areas through protocol incentives once the incentive program ends. This strategy can better retain activity and position the application more favorably than others in its sector.Potential ImprovementsDespite the positive STIP outcomes of the protocols analyzed, certain potential improvements were identified that could have made their use of incentives yield even greater results.Onboarding New Users Has the Greatest Positive Impact: This is easier said than done, given the general microstructure of DeFi.  It would be highly beneficial for applications running on Arbitrum and the Arbitrum ecosystem broadly for incentives to experiment with onboarding new users without getting exploited by sybils.Aspire to Broaden the Incentive Distribution: Expanding on the previous point highlights that the wider the incentive effect, the more diverse and extensive the onboarded activity will be, leading to a healthier application marketplace. Exactly what determines the optimal distribution is application-specific, with different types of apps naturally growing different activity concentration microstructures.Align Incentives with Ecosystem Goals: It does not make sense to grow elements of the Arbitrum ecosystem that are being deprecated over the long term. Bridged USDC.e growth is one element identified that grew as a result of these incentives and is being wound down, making it not an optimal area to target with incentives.ConclusionThe three case studies performed on Vertex Protocol, Silo Finance, and Pendle Finance provided many vital takeaways for Arbitrum DAO members and protocols to consider in future incentive programs.  This analysis covered the impact of the STIP program from a risk and efficiency standpoint.Although little consequence was observed due to risks manifesting, this can be attributed to market conditions at the program outset, and future iterations will likely play out differently.  We recommend close scrutiny of the potential for incentives to drive users too far along the risk curve, to the point where the ecosystem destabilizes.  Protocols should be asked to include a plan to contain the impacts of incentive-induced excessive risk-taking in their application forms going forward.Several consistent behaviors led to the success of these protocols’ incentive programs. The consistency of these behaviors, along with their overlap with traditional digital marketing strategies, gives us confidence in recommending their implementation in future incentive programs.Lastly, a brief list of incentive attributes that were not included but could have further enhanced the impact of these programs is provided. These elements are not straightforward or as evident as the positive aspects and should be considered as areas for future experimentation and improvement."

This is the third and final case study of a three-part series that entails an in-depth analysis of the risk and efficiency of the Arbitrum STIP on three major protocols, the third of which is Pendle Finance.As requested by the DAO advocate for the ARDC, L2BEAT, Chaos Labs has been conducting case studies on STIP recipients. This case study provides an in-depth analysis of the Arbitrum STIP program’s impact on Pendle Finance, focusing on its efficiency and associated risks. This analysis is part of a broader series that evaluates the STIP program across three major protocols.Following our previous analyses of Vertex and Silo Finance, we now turn our focus to Pendle Finance to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance and risk profile.IntroductionAn in-depth, bottom-up analysis of the protocol is essential to comprehensively understand the specific risks and efficiency factors influencing the Pendle STIP allocation. The initial section of this report delves into all pertinent aspects of Pendle Finance’s functionality, providing context and reference.Following this, detailed analyses of efficiency and risk are conducted, using the insights gained from the protocol deep-dive as a foundation. This analysis aims to identify all factors that could potentially result in adverse outcomes. These findings are then used to derive positive and negative insights from the Pendle STIP incentive program, which will inform the design of future incentive schemes.Incentive Amount: 2m ARBIncentive Uses: Liquidity incentives (55%), trading incentives (40%), Ecosystem integrations (5%)Grant Matching: YesPendle OverviewPendle is a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can execute various yield-management strategies. This is achieved by first wrapping yield-bearing tokens into Standardised Yield (SY) tokens. SY tokens are compatible with the Pendle AMM and can be split into its principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token), respectively. This process is called yield tokenisation and allows both PT and YT to be traded on Pendle’s AMM.By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield, enabling users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:Fixed yield (e.g. earn fixed yield on stETH)Long yield (e.g. bet on stETH yield going up by purchasing more yield)Earn more yield without additional risks (e.g. provide liquidity with your stETH)A mix of the above strategiesEach PT and YT has a maturity date. For PT, you can redeem the full underlying yield-bearing token after this date. For YT, the yield of the yield-bearing token is only accrued up until the maturity date, after which YT has no value.Pendle LiquidityPendle liquidity comes from holders of yield-bearing tokens wrapping and depositing them into AMM pools. These liquidity providers then earn swap fees, PENDLE rewards, and any other incentives on top of the tokens’ native yield. The fixed maturity nature of these pools also means that if LPs keep providing liquidity until maturity, there will be no impermanent loss, and they will receive their initial tokens back along with the additional yield.During the STIP, Pendle launched an Order Book system alongside its AMM to enable peer-to-peer trading of PT and YT. This allows users to place limit orders to buy or sell at a specified implied APY.Together, the Order Book and AMM enhance market liquidity, facilitating smoother trading on Pendle.The total liquidity in a pool impacts slippage and is therefore crucial for user experience and seamlessly offering the use cases users desire.Pendle TradingLiquidity pools in Pendle V2 are set up as PT/SY, e.g. PT-aUSDC / SY-aUSDC. Swapping PT is a straightforward process of swapping between the two assets in the pool, while swapping YT is enabled via flash swaps in the same pool.Flash swaps are possible due to the relationship between PT and YT. As PT and YT can be minted from and redeemed to its underlying SY, we can express the price relationship:P(PT) + P(YT) = P(Underlying)​Knowing that YT price has an inverted correlation against PT price, we use this price relationship to utilise the PT/SY pool for YT swaps.Traders on Pendle obtain SY tokens by depositing yield-bearing tokens, and swap them to gain exposure to the token of their choice. As yields change they then have the option to trade further to alter their exposures.Pendle Yield Token IntegrationsA key feature of Pendle’s principal and yield tokens is their ability to support strategies that create specific exposures for users, enabled by ecosystem integrations with other protocols. Pendle offered incentives for depositing PT or LP positions into specific pools on other protocols to foster the broader ecosystem, liquidity, and trading activity. This initiative began in Week 5 of the program and was adjusted based on general market sentiment.Use of IncentivesThe objectives for the STIP, as stated by Pendle, were:Increasing yield trading volume, inciting activity on the platform, deepening liquidity on existing pools as well as an additional incentive for users to bootstrap liquidity for newly listed Pendle markets Arbitrum, and finally to encourage activity on protocols built on top of Pendle.This was implemented by allocating 55% of incentives towards liquidity providers on Pendle, 40% towards trading incentives, and 5% to ecosystem incentives.Liquidity Incentives:Slightly over half of the total incentives were allocated to boosting additional yield for LPs, aiming to encourage deeper liquidity and reduce slippage on Pendle.Initially, Pendle distributed liquidity incentives based on vePENDLE votes for Arbitrum pools. However, this approach soon proved suboptimal as the incentives were neither distributed broadly nor targeted at the most active markets or new markets needing support. Starting from week 3, the Pendle team took over the allocations, using metrics such as the most active yield markets and new pools requiring initial liquidity. Additionally, there was significant experimentation and iteration in the weekly allocations.The chart below shows the evolution of weekly incentives by category. Over the course of the STIP, incentives were redirected from LST and derivative LP markets to lending, LRT, and Silo Pendle LP markets in response to market interest.The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category2048×1304 107 KBTrading Incentives:Trading incentives were designed as campaigns targeted at increasing trading activity on Pendle. The initial STIP application suggested that there would be “at least one campaign per month will be done to keep things fresh and to entice users to keep trying out the campaigns.” Over the course of the STIP, the following campaigns were conducted:Swap fee rebates: This campaign refunded a portion of traders’ swap fees with ARB tokens. The rebate was set below 100% to ensure wash trading remained unprofitable, starting at 75% and reducing to 50% in week 9. This campaign ran for the entire duration of the STIP.Trading leaderboard with prizes for the most successful traders: An in-app leaderboard showcased the top-ranked users based on percentage gain. These top performers received ARB rewards to stimulate more trading volume and TVL. Performance-based prizes also incentivized traders to improve their strategies, aiding in long-term retention.Supercharged swap fee rebates: For a limited time, certain pools had their swap fee rebates increased to 120% to further incentivize trading activity.Maker incentives to promote the new limit order book feature: Rewards were provided for using Pendle’s newly launched limit order feature. Filled limit orders earned ARB rewards proportional to the order size, drawing attention to this innovation. Pendle’s limit orders were initially launched on Arbitrum.Ecosystem Incentives:Ecosystem incentives were designed to integrate Pendle tokens further into the broader DeFi ecosystem by encouraging their use on partner protocols. Large lending pools that accepted Pendle LP or PT tokens as collateral received ARB incentives to boost their usage. The incentivized protocols included Stella, Dolomite, Timeswap, Silo, and Teller.Similar to the liquidity incentives, the focus of these incentives evolved throughout the STIP. Notably, in February 2024, the incentives shifted to emphasize leveraged strategies using LRT PT tokens, aligning with the development of these markets.Pendle Incentives ImpactThe objective of this impact assessment is to evaluate the effects of the incentive program on protocol activity, specifically examining the demand for holding Pendle PT and YT tokens, trading activity and liquidity provision on Pendle’s AMM. This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Pendle. This allows a clear prescription of how the results of the program were obtained and how this could be applied to other protocols. The unique nature of the Pendle protocol makes direct comparison impossible, but important incentive principles can be gleaned from their program strategy.Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion. The intention is to identify persistent activity changes and what drove them.Pendle accepts deposits of yield-bearing assets, wraps these into standardized yield (SY) tokens, and splits these into Principal (PT) and yield (YT) tokens. These PT and YT tokens are then bought and sold on the Pendle AMM, with Arbitrum end users primarily leveraging their PT positions or holding YT for yield.Therefore, the impact analysis will focus on the effects of the incentives on the growth of the supply of yield-bearing assets available for trading (the supply side), the growth in the trading of Pendle yield tokens (trading activity), and the growth of ecosystem TVL.The effectiveness of Pendle’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions:How did the incentives affect the supply of yield-bearing assets by LPs?How did the incentives affect trading activity on the Pendle AMM?Did they attract new users?How did incentives affect retention?How did incentives affect the average volume per user?How did incentives affect the ecosystem growth of Pendle tokens?The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.Liquidity Provider ReactionsLiquidity from AMM LPs on Pendle grew from $52 million to $723 million over the STIP period. Most of this growth occurred between February and March 2024, driven by points programs on Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that were ideally suited to Pendle’s products. The increase in LRT TVL during this period was clearly due to the demand for Pendle’s offerings, although this growth on Arbitrum was positively affected by the STIP use.Pendle’s focus on Arbitrum during this time, enhanced by STIP incentives, brought significant LRT TVL to Arbitrum and added considerable value to the chain. Without these incentives, LRT strategies on Pendle Arbitrum would have been less attractive, and the supply may not have grown as it did. It is also important to highlight how the attention flywheel established Arbitrum as a prominent hub for leveraged LRT strategies, with the incentives having a highly asymmetric effect on its success.Total Pendle LP Supply2048×1276 109 KBThe aggressive growth observed after the launch of LRTs overshadows the performance during the first three months of the STIP. Focusing on the period from July 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, a clear trend emerges with LP supply increasing from $52 million to $116 million by the end of January. Most of this growth occurred within the first six weeks of the STIP, before the launch of ecosystem incentives. It remains unclear whether these alternative avenues for accessing STIP rewards competed with LP supplies or if an equilibrium was reached between demand and supply, making the timing coincidental.LP Supply up to the end of January 2024.2048×1250 109 KBTrading ActivityThese metrics focus on Pendle’s AMM activity. This is where fees are generated on the protocol.Weekly Trading VolumeLike AMM supply, trading activity skyrocketed once LRTs launched. Weekly trading volumes grew from approximately $4m before the STIP to approximately $450m at its conclusion. This far exceeded the initial stated goal of 20m in monthly volume.Pendle Weekly Volume Growth2048×1254 118 KBThe scale of Pendle’s growth once LRTs launched masks its earlier growth trajectory, which was impressive enough in its own right. Zooming in on Pendle volumes to the end of January 2024 shows two distinct growth phases in Pendle trading volumes before the third LRT-driven acceleration in March 2024. At the program’s outset, weekly volumes immediately tripled before remaining at this level for four weeks. Rebalancing incentives from LSTs to derivatives LP markets in early December 2023 reignited trading growthPendle Weekly Volume Growth2048×1160 96.8 KBTotal Trader NumbersTrader numbers increased only slightly until February 2024, when LRTs launched. Earlier incentives targeting derivative LPs, LSTs, and lending aTokens had no discernable impact on trader numbers.Weekly Active Traders2048×1250 131 KBNew User AcquisitionThroughout the STIP, 10,556 new users interacted with Pendle. There was no noticeable increase in the rate at which new users were onboarded to Pendle over the STIP until LRTs were onboarded until February 2024. This acceleration in new users was caused more by market developments than by the STIP, and we conclude that the incentives had little impact on attracting new users.New Pendle Users2048×1254 111 KBUser RetentionThe weekly retention rate on Pendle is defined as the percentage of traders who engaged in at least one trade in the previous week and continued to trade in the current week.Overall, the chart below shows the weekly retention rate in blue and the 4-week m.a. (red dots) clearly improving significantly for the duration of the STIP before dropping to prior levels after. We interpret this as a signal that traders who were attracted to try Pendle by the STIP rewards valued the program and remained engaged throughout the program.Pendle Trading Retention2048×1160 146 KBAverage Weekly User VolumeMost of the growth in trading volume on Pendle came from the increasing average weekly volume per trader rather than an increase in the number of traders.The trader segment attracted by LRTs is clearly users with a higher volume, who are able to increase their weekly trading volume significantly.Average Weekly Trader Volume2048×1160 112 KBSupercharged Swap FeesThe 120% supercharged swap fee rebate creates the potential for inorganic wash trading. The rapid growth of over 400% in just four weeks suggests some signs of wash trading activity, particularly in the gDAI market. However, aside from the gDAI market, the supercharged markets maintained higher weekly volumes even after the period ended. We conclude that while there may have been some wash trading in the gDAI market, the increased activity in other markets was mainly unrelated to wash trading.Weekly Volumes in Supercharged Swap Fee Markets2048×1224 153 KBWeekly trading volumes in supercharged swap fee pools highlighting the period when the program was live.Weekly Volumes in Supercharged Swap Fee Markets (excl. gDAI)2048×1224 140 KBWeekly trading volumes in supercharged swap fee markets excluding the gDAI market highlighting the period when the program was live. Volumes began accelerating before the program began, and maintained well after it concluded. We find no real evidence of wash trading at scale in these markets.Ecosystem GrowthFor most of the STIP, the growth of TVL in ecosystem-incentivized pools was relatively muted. However, there was a clear growth in Stella of PT pools, justifying the majority of ecosystem incentives flowing there.In the last month of the Program, Pendle switched the focus of this incentive segment, directing most incentives to the Silo eETH PT pool initially and two Dolomite LRT PT pools in the last four weeks. The impact here was dramatic, with TVL in these pools growing from $5m to $58m over five weeks.Pendle Ecosystem Integrations TVL2048×1224 122 KBPendle Incentive DistributionPendle rewards were distributed across 4489* wallets with limited concentration amongst the highest earners. Only 40% of rewards went to the top 10 wallets, which is much lower than typically seen. The highest earner only earned 18% of total rewards.This, combined with the observation that there was no benefit to Sybil activity, leads us to conclude that the program’s rewards materially benefited a large number of users.Rewards claimed by the Penpie pool are further broken down by the end users claiming them. Only wallets claiming at least 1 ARB are counted.Claimed Rewards Breakdown by Rank2048×1216 109 KBIncentive Risk AnalysisThe incentive risk analysis uses the above deep bottom-up analysis of the Pendle Protocol to inform the specific potential manifestations of these risks in a protocol-specific context.Pendle Risk Factors Under InvestigationPendle incentives create excessive speculation: This could destabilize aspects of the protocol, cause excessive user losses, or potentially affect ecosystem partners.Pendle incentives skew the natural growth of trading activity and liquidity: This could cause risks such as bad debts from liquidation slippage, or poor user experience.Pendle incentives do not grow liquidity over the long term: Liquidity leaves once STIP incentives end.Incentives do not lead to sustained trading activity: Trading activity leaves once STIP incentives end.Each of these risks are individually covered in detail below.Pendle incentives create excessive speculationDespite significant enthusiasm for leveraged strategies involving Pendle yield tokens, there has been limited destabilizing behavior or liquidations. We conclude that, to date, there has been no evidence of excessive speculation spilling over to negative externalities.Pendle incentives skew the natural growth of trading activity and liquidityThere are currently no direct yield token competitors on Arbitrum, so this use case is novel to Pendle. There is no unnatural growth because of the incentives.Pendle incentives do not grow liquidity over the long termAlthough it fluctuates according to market conditions, Pendle liquidity remains more than 60x where it started at the beginning of the STIP.Incentives do not lead to sustained trading activitySimilar to liquidity, trading volumes have increased by over 40x from the beginning of the STIP.Key TakeawaysPendle Incentive PositivesUsing Incentives to Amplify New Protocol Upgrades and AnnouncementsThis often-overlooked aspect of incentive programs can go almost unnoticed. Pendle allocated significant incentives to the most exciting new pools, enabling them to scale rapidly. Similarly, new ecosystem pools received early incentive support. The introduction of limit orders also garnered more attention due to maker order incentives throughout the entire second half of the program.Keeping the Incentive Criteria Clear and SimpleThe incentive criteria on Pendle were extremely clear, even though they iterated throughout the program. Liquidity providers in incentivized pools received incremental yield in the form of ARB tokens.Growing The Protocol Through Incentivized IntegrationsThis was an important focus area for Pendle, unlocking incremental utility for its yield tokens.Iterating and ExperimentingPendle aggressively experimented and culled underperforming strategies on a fortnightly basis using market data.Some positive examples included:The focused but aggressive iteration in liquidity pools incentivized. Pendle targeted incentives aimed at increasing activity where the market was at almost every week. This enabled hypergrowth in LRT markets in February, almost since launch.Iteration in ecosystem incentives, resulting in the highly productive growth in Silo pools, offering leverage and growing YT token utility.Experiments in trading campaigns.Pendle Incentive Potential ImprovementsGrow the Rate of New User Acquisition As Well As TVL and ActivityFor most of the STIP Pendle active users, there was little change from the prior period. While it is true that volumes increased significantly, growing the user base along with overall volumes and TVL could have great long-term benefits.Pendle Ecosystem Integrations on Dolomite and Timeswap GLP, wstETH and rETH Markets Had a Poor ROI while Continuing Receiving IncentivesDolomite rETH and GLP markets received 31 500 ARB over 14 weeks during the STIP, but only grew to a combined $345k in TVL. Timeswap GLP received 10,000 ARB and only grew to $485k. Both of these pools continued receiving incentives despite poor ROI, and these incentives could have likely been better used in alternative ways.Pendle STIP Useful ResourcesApplication:STIP ApplicationBi-weekly updates:Forum Thread"

OpenZeppelin was asked by the ARDC to review the AIP. We assume that readers have read the AIP or at least the gentle introduction to which the AIP refers. Our analysis focuses on the parameters of BOLD involving the distribution of confiscated funds and their implications for the future.ImpressionsOverall we were impressed with the amount of work that went into creating BOLD as well as the thoroughness of the analysis, and the quality of the documentation. The several documents linked in the AIP describe its intricacies well and do so effectively to the different target audiences. If they could be improved, we would suggest adopting a single nomenclature across the several documents (e.g. “challenge bond” vs. “mini-bond”, “challenge period 1” vs. ”dispute period”).Confiscated FundsThe current validation scheme allows anyone to propose the next state in a canonical state chain, and users stake funds on which state they believe to be the correct next state. This proposed next state could be wrong, so anyone is allowed to dispute a proposed state within a confirmation period and losing a dispute means your assertion stake is confiscated. We were asked to consider possible ways for confiscated funds to be rewarded within the system. The research provided is extremely concerned about collusion between challengers, and we share this concern.Reward funds based on actual network delayOne of the strengths of BOLD is that creating disputes does not significantly delay confirmation of the blocks assuming that there is no censorship of honest parties. So in a world without censorship, consider an honest party that is disputed by a malicious user. If their dispute ends before the challenge period is over, then no delay to the network has taken place and the honest block will become confirmed. If in reality both parties were the same and the malicious user was disputing with themselves, then it shouldn’t matter if they get a portion of their own stake as they’ve caused no delay and submitted an honest state for the network. The principle stated in the Economics paper is to have the assertion bond amount equal to the opportunity cost to the network of the maximum delay (one week). And this we believe could be a guiding principle in rewarding confiscated funds. Honest parties could get more of the confiscated funds the less time an honest state is delayed in confirmation. For example, consider bad states being posted and pruned quickly, honest parties could receive those funds.Now let us consider censorship. If an honest state confirmation were delayed past the challenge period because honest parties were censored from sending dispute transactions, then it becomes less costly for malicious parties to delay the network if they are part of the honest party and receive their own confiscated stake. This is textbook griefing and should be discouraged. But there could be a sliding scale between the two scenarios. The function could be nuanced with cliffs where no rewards are transferred or exponentially decay as a state is delayed, but the overarching incentive could be in place where honest parties receive confiscated funds and more if state is not delayed.There are some nuances surrounding waiting for paying out only to confirmed blocks. For example, if a bad state actor can censor honest parties from asserting, they can play disputes with themselves and win their own disputes but the “winning” bad state will not be confirmed once honest parties are able to send transactions to the network. They should not receive their rewards in this scenario and this delaying of paying rewards leads into another idea for how confiscated funds could be paid to honest parties.Postpone rewarding fundsNext, consider a scenario where dishonest stakes are given to honest parties after six months. And again, let us consider the scenario above where a malicious user raises disputes with themselves at every honest state they post, delaying confirmation of states for as long as possible with censorship. Such a malicious user would need extraordinary capital to continuously delay states for six months. In such a scenario, if the DAO were able to recognize the network duress and also were able to vote and stop the delayed reward payments, the malicious user’s attack would then become much more expensive to continue (hopefully prohibitively more expensive). Our understanding is that BOLD does not preclude determined, large entities from performing this kind of attack. Indeed, any such optimistic rollup is susceptible to this. However, the network duress would be quite obvious and allow the DAO to make decisions about delaying rewards to protect the network.Now consider a malicious user that does not have the capital to perform this attack continuously. They would be able to perform the attack more often after receiving rewards for disputing with themselves. However, the actual rewards would be delayed substantially, perhaps enough so that the delays they cause to the network provide no material difficulty for its users. Therefore, the longer an honest party has to wait for their funds, the less the risk of delays to the network and, therefore, the greater the share of the confiscated funds could be paid. And again, if there are enough malicious users out there to cause delays to the network (perhaps all operating separately), giving the DAO the ability to turn off the payments should discourage the “market” for bad states.The obvious criticism with this method is that it introduces a special role into a permissionless system. But this is already a component of the AIP, giving the DAO all of the confiscated funds and the ability to use those funds how they wish. This privileged role the DAO will have in these cases can always be removed in newer iterations of the dispute protocol. So its temporary power to pause delayed rewards does not seem so unpalatable.The Changing Economic EnvironmentBOLD sufficiently incentivizes parties to behave in ways that are beneficial to the network. Indeed, the success of BOLD relies on some of these incentives being sufficient at all times to induce the desired behavior. To this end, we were very pleased to see the proposal including the idea about service fees being paid to validators and honest disputers. This may be enough to incentivize validators and it may be the case that there need not be any further reward policy for confiscated funds. But it is an utmost priority to observe how these incentives actually perform. Should validators/disputers simply find better things to do with their locked assertion assets, they will leave their role, and the network will suffer. BOLD does a good job of guaranteeing the correctness of the state chain as long as one honest member exists. However, there exists a very perverse incentive for the last honest actor to be dishonest since no one is left to challenge them. So, in practice, more than one honest actor is ideal, and monitoring the health of the validator pool should become an ongoing DAO responsibility. We would hope that the number of validators and the amounts staked become a regular talking point, brought up at large. In fact, we recommend the DAO regularly monitor and discuss all of the factors in the proposal that determine the economic parameters at least until the community feels incredibly confident with BOLD’s performance. These parameters include the price of WETH, yield rates, the TVL of the bridge, the time-to-depletion for DAO payouts, and more. Gathering this information could be a simple, manual task performed by a specific DAO entity, and many of these values seem scrapable which would make this monitoring even easier. In this sense, adopting BOLD should be understood as the DAO adopting the responsibility for the economics of BOLD and the community’s confidence in it.ConclusionGiven the serious security implications of allowing permissionless disputes, we are pleased and impressed with the level of thoroughness with which the Offchain Labs team and Arbitrum community has discussed the risks of BOLD.We explored concerns with the handling of confiscated funds as well as the future need to monitor and update BOLD parameters as economic conditions change. The algorithm has been well thought-out and should work as expected. However, it does depend on economic incentives behaving under present economic conditions that are subject to change. We recommend monitoring the economic factors of BOLD once in production and be ready to make adjustments as needed.For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our Notion homepage 1.EDIT: Our first version of this post attempted to explain BOLD in terms of the “Classic” dispute mechanism but confused some readers because it didn’t clearly distinguish between censorship and non-censorship scenarios. We’ve edited this post on June 19th to use more precise language in describing the different scenarios under consideration."

On a high-level, the 4 aspects that helped us drive our decision were:Strong technical knowledgeIt’s imperative for each member of the security council to be able to independently verify what they’re signing, but to also understand the underlying technology and code. We are willing to support also members that bring other skills like deep knowledge of legal implications that add significant value to the security council.Reputation at stakeWhile we respect the wish for some members of the community to remain anonymous, we believe that members of the security council should have their identities known, so that if they misbehave or fail to act on time, they risk slashing their public reputation. We are willing to make an exception only for well known anons with exceptional reputation.No connection to OffChain Labs or Arbitrum FoundationWe wanted to limit the support for individuals or entities that are related to the original founding team (OffChain Labs and Arbitrum Foundation) as we believe that Security Council should serve as a third party guardian that protects the users of the protocol.LocationSecurity council members should be spread around the world to cover most timezones and various jurisdictions as that would help with reaction speed in case of emergency, and would mitigate the risk of legal implications.With that in mind, we voted for the following nominees:Philipp Jovanovic - Associate Professor in Information Technology at University College London (UK)Philipp has a very strong technical background and with 12+ years of experience in cybersecurity. He’s involved in various projects in his capacity as a cybersecurity consultant and he’s experienced in cryptography, distributed systems security, privacy-enhancing technologies, cryptocurrencies among other fields.Haroon.eth - PhD on Crypto Analytics & Security (UK)Haroon also has a very strong technical background and he has professional experience in blockchain security and analytics. He has published numerous academic articles and research on blockchain and security and he’s also on the technical committee of the IC3.Emiliano Bonassi - Tech at Conduit (Italy)Emiliano comes from a researcher background with strong technical knowledge and experience in web3 security since 2020. He has been supporting and leading various war rooms, discovering security issues on Yearn and Synthetix.And while we don’t have enough voting power to also help qualify the following 2, we’ve voted for them as well to indicate our strong support.Caleb Lau - Software Developer at Etherscan (Malaysia)Like with the other nominees, Caleb has a very strong technical background, and he also has the experience of being on the security council as a member of the previous cohort.Paul Imseih - Founder and Principal of Daimon Legal (Australia)In our opinion, Paul would make for a great addition to the council despite not having as strong technical knowledge as other nominees. Paul has provided legal advice and had leadership roles during cybersecurity incidents in the past which would make him a good fit for covering the legal aspect of any actions of the security council."

The software upgrade is a response to vulnerabilities that could have affected the availability of the chains. This document describes what was done and why the actions were justified (as required per Section 3 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution).The Arbitrum Foundation notified the Security Council of two vulnerabilities affecting the ArbitrumDAO-governed chains. The vulnerabilities made it possible to halt the ability of normal users to transact on the network and ultimately the execution of DeFi applications. The security council successfully mitigated all concerns before any exploitation occurred. The issues consisted of:Node Crash. ArbOS Panic due to specially crafted Stylus ProgramImpact: All nodes will crash if a transaction with this program is included in a block, including the sequencer.Mispriced Opcodes. Storage opcode is mispriced in Stylus and it is effectively free to store values.Impact: An attacker can craft a transaction that bloats state and effectively perform a denial of service attack on the network.Both issues posed significant risk to the availability of the chains, and thus the Security Council deemed it necessary to execute an Emergency Action to upgrade the chain software. The source code for the software upgrade is now publicly available (Release Arbitrum Nitro v3.2.0 · OffchainLabs/nitro · GitHub).Great care has been taken to minimize the impact on current operations on the ecosystem whilst not putting them at risk of the vulnerability being exploited. The vulnerability had to be contained and handled on a need-to-know basis until mitigations were ready to be deployed. To help ensure node operators had actionable time to upgrade, a node software binary (but not its source code) was released with support for the fixes. In case some attacker was able to identify the vulnerability as result of the updated and released node software, the Security Council also was ready with an Emergency Action that could pause all Stylus smart contracts, thus mitigating the vulnerability without impact on any EVM smart contracts. Fortunately there was no need to employ this recourse.Timeline of eventsSeptember 18, 2024: The Arbitrum Foundation disclosed to the Security Council that an issue had been identified in the ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.Security Council members were alerted to be on-call to evaluate a proposed software upgrade that was being finalized.September 21, 2024 (morning UTC): Source code for the proposed software upgrade, as well as an audit report by Trail of Bits, were shared with the Security Council for their evaluation.The Foundation proposed an action plan on how to effectively mitigate risks during the upgrade and minimize impact.September 21, 2024 (evening UTC): A transaction was initiated and signatures started being collected by members as they completed their respective due diligence processes.Fellow Security Council members collaborated to ensure the upgrade was sound and justified.September 22, 2024 (morning UTC): Member signatures were progressively collected as they verified the proposed upgrade and transactions.September 22, 2024 (evening UTC): Initial comms were shared with the public for them to update their node software to support the upcoming upgrade. The source code was not released and it was not mentioned that this was a security patch.A sufficient quorum of signatures were available to initiate the upgrade, but it was decided to wait and give the community actionable time to upgrade their node software, thus mitigating any potential disruption of service.September 23, 2024: Public comms were shared making it known that the upcoming upgrade was a security patch, but no details shared as to the nature of the vulnerability.September 25, 2024: The Emergency Action was initiated onchain and upgraded the software for ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.Transactions:Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | EtherscanArbitrum Nova Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Arbitrum NovaArbitrum One Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Arbitrum One"

Being a member of the security council would align with our team’s mission, having already been part of the zkSync security council and having worked for various stakeholders in the Arbitrum and greater Ethereum community. You can find further information about our application below:MotivationAt Dedaub, our fundamental mission is to enhance the security and resilience of the Web3 ecosystem. We are committed to safeguarding decentralized platforms and building trust within the community. Joining the Arbitrum Security Council represents an opportunity for us to extend our positive impact by collaborating with like-minded professionals dedicated to safeguarding a major ecosystem. Our previous initiatives, such as being a founding member of the Security Alliance (https://securityalliance.org), memberships in other security councils, and security vulnerability disclosures on 3rd party protocols such as Uniswap reflect our commitment to this cause.A secondary motivation is that we have a number of our partners (e.g. the Arbitrum DAO procurement committee) and clients such as GMX and Pendle rely on the security of the Arbitrum network, further aligning us with this role. Therefore, we believe that by contributing our expertise to the Arbitrum Security Council, we can help fortify the platform, ensuring a safer environment for its users and stakeholders.Relevant ExperienceDedaub brings a wealth of experience in blockchain security and smart contract auditing. Our team has conducted security audits and security impact studies for the Ethereum Foundation, ensuring the Ethereum ecosystem evolves in a secure manner. Additionally, we are a member of the security council for zkSync, which presents similar challenges to being a security council member on Arbitrum.Our experience extends to auditing important projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem, such as GMX. We have also actively participated in high-stakes bug bounty programs and emergency response scenarios. One such example is our security disclosure on the Multichain bridge, whereby we helped move $1B in various tokens that were immediately at risk. There are many other examples of ecosystem threats whereby the Dedaub team was roped in to help in a war room scenario. Experiences like this demonstrate our ability to perform under pressure and deliver effective solutions.Being a founding member of the Security Alliance underscores our collaborative approach to industry-wide security challenges. Additionally, our role as a security advisor to the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) has allowed us to influence procurement strategies with a security-first mindset. This diverse experience equips us with the insights and skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to the Arbitrum Security Council.Other Legal ConsiderationsDedaub is Domiciled and Resident in Malta, a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Our addition would also provide further jurisdictional diversity to the Arbitrum security council."

I believe my background in blockchain security and analytics, as well as my passion for Arbitrum, would make me a strong member of the Arbitrum Security Council.Qualifications and relevant experienceI am very fortunate to work with amazing people, obtained a PhD from a top university in the United Kingdom, and have published multiple papers at top tier security conferences worldwide. This allowed me to gain deep insights into various blockchain tech and vulnerabilities. These of course all resulted in favourable outcomes to the ecosystems. The core of my work is on privacy, security and scams. Below is a short selection:(Privacy/Security) An Empirical Analysis of Zcash - The first published work on analysing the security and participants of ZCash, detailing how the privacy features could be abused(Privacy/Security) Tracing transactions across cryptocurrency ledgers - We analysed multiple blockchains, identified ways to track wallets across ledgers and exposed scammers(Privacy/Security) An Empirical Analysis of Privacy in the Lightning Network - We developed techniques in order to see how payments are pathed(Scams) Forsage: Anatomy of a Smart-Contract Pyramid Scheme  - Exposed one of the largest pyramid schemes in the world hosted on EthereumI currently work as a Quant @ Blockchain.com! Prior to this I worked in R&D at Pometry developing state-of-the-art graph analytics tools. My work revolves around analytics and software development primarily on graphs and blockchains. We’ve done work on Sybil detection with Gitcoin and hunted NFTs used in pump and dump schemes. I am also on the technical committee for the IC3, where I help organise our bi-annual events and hackathons.You can find a fuller list of my qualifications here with links to all of my works: https://www.haaroonyousaf.comPersonal BackgroundI started my cryptocurrency journey back in 2016 whenever I tried to buy L$ on the Virwox (now shut down) exchange, either I placed the wrong type of market order or got scammed. This experience spurred my interest in cryptocurrency, I wanted to do something about it.My thesis was simple, there are insane amounts of tech being made, I believe if there is an attack then someone evil is probably already exploiting it. Thus, I wanted to find and bring exploits to light so they can be fixed to improve the security of the ecosystem. This was why I obtained a PhD and committed to work on blockchain security.Real world security - Outside of crypto I have real world experience in development and security, I have worked at security company in the past (MWR), was a developer at Goldman Sachs and obtained a bug bounty (NDA’d)Arbitrum - I have been active within the arbitrum community, usually by speaking to developers or researchers in the space. You can see an example here, where I discussed transaction ordering on the research forum two years ago Hybrid transaction ordering policy - sequencer - Arbitrum ResearchSecurity Council CriteriaAvailability - Being responsive is a key trait, but being calm in a crisis is non-negotiable. I pledge to be accessible both during emergencies and regular operations, as well as being calm in a matter of emergency. This I have experience in when working for as a Quant @ Blockchain(.)com, and in TradFi in the past where critical financial systems had issues and I had to give support.Teamwork - I strongly believe that outstanding work is done as a team, and having mutual respect and collaboration has been a guiding principle when working in a team.Transparent - I genuinely believe in Trust but verify and commit to stay on top with the DAOs reports and security council related docs. I also welcome questions, and will gladly answer any below.Secure Operations - Given my security and academic background I assure you that I prioritise high levels of security. With this engagement I will purchase extra phone contract lines and keys to ensure availability is at its highest level, with the most updated and secure devices and careful management of security matters.Blockchain Security + ToolsI believe the council should be made up of extremely tech savvy individuals who all must have a security mindset. My experience and track record show that I have those qualities.I can read and write Solidity - which is necessary for understanding potential actions taking placeExtremely familiar with using blockchain explorers, such as EtherScan, or obtaining data and analysing it myself - necessary for understanding and comprehending an ongoing attacks, postmortem analysis, verifying code and analysing address behavioursUsed hardware wallets - which is necessary for private key securityPersonal security - I actively use 2FA, ensure my device hard drives are encrypted and almost all of my social media (excluding LinkedIn) are set to privateUnderstand Gnosis safe - how it is necessary for co-signing security council transactionsI have accounts on both the Arbitrum foundation and research forums, and understand tools such as Tallyand Snapshot are used as voting mechanismsConclusionI am sincerely excited about joining the Security Council, given the chance to uphold the responsibilities that accompany this role.I welcome any questions, feedback and conversations from anyone in the community. We can all work towards keeping Arbitrum secure. If you would like to contact me, please feel free to DM me on the forums here or post a question in this thread.I hope this post inspires your confidence to vote for me as a nominee.I originally had links to all works and citations, but unfortunately am limited by the security of the forum"

My responsibilities extend across several critical areas including operational security (OpSec), community support, troubleshooting, bug and vulnerability reporting, and more. Additionally, I have been a part of the Community Multisig committee at Hop Protocol for over a year, contributing to key governance decisions and securing community funds. I believe my unique blend of experience in these areas makes me an excellent candidate for the Security Council.Operational Security (OpSec): In my current role, I prioritize the safety and security of our community members across all platforms, from Discord to our Forum, and beyond into broader web security. My proactive approach to OpSec has led to the elimination of over 150 phishing websites impersonating Hop Protocol, achieved by reporting these threats to MetaMask, various domain registrar providers, and Google.During a significant security incident involving our Discord server, where a moderator’s account was compromised, I acted swiftly to contain the breach. By disabling the compromised account’s access within minutes, I ensured that the impact on our community was minimal. This swift response was made possible by implementing a least privilege access model, which I advocate for and enforce rigorously.Community Support & Troubleshooting: Beyond security, I am deeply involved in providing community support and troubleshooting issues as they arise. This includes identifying and reporting bugs and vulnerabilities that could affect the user experience or the security of the platform. My hands-on approach ensures that our community remains engaged, informed, and secure.Background in DevOps: In addition to my work in the crypto space, I bring a strong background as a DevOps engineer with a specialization in production incident resolution. My experience spans handling critical incidents during both regular business hours and 24/7 on-call shifts. I have led cross-team war rooms during critical incidents and have conducted thorough root cause analyses to prevent future occurrences.Why I’m a Fit for the Security Council: My extensive experience in operational security within the Hop Protocol community, combined with my technical expertise in DevOps, positions me uniquely to contribute meaningfully to the Security Council. I am passionate about safeguarding our community and have a proven track record of taking proactive measures to mitigate risks and address threats swiftly.I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience, dedication, and proactive mindset to the Security Council, ensuring the continued safety and resilience of our community."

I believe that being a trustworthy actor in a ‘trustless ecosystem’ such as crypto is ironically valuable. I’m proud to say I’ve been a signer on over 4 multi-million dollar multi-sig SAFEs, so I’d like to consider myself a trusted actor in the space.Security ChopsI started my Security journey the old fashioned way, learning scriptkiddie antics in my teenage years, and graduated through the ranks in my early career at AT&T and Lockheed Martin via → Call center tech support → Help Desk → System Admin → Security Operations Center → until finally consulting and cyber risk management for companies like Microsoft and Two Sigma.Why Me?Its safe to say I’m not Johnny-come-lately to crypto. I was posting in the bitcointalk forums on the night of the HODL meme’s birth, and poured one out when Hal Finney passed. This ecosystem, for better or worse, is my family. My home. I’ve also been on-call and have been responsible for bringing systems back online for many years throughout my career.

This focus is simultaneously my vocation and my passion: there’s little distinction between work and free time. Researchers, developers, and security experts are both my colleagues and social circle.Providing secure hardware for critical self-custody applications makes me uniquely suitable for the role, because I understand the full gravity of the responsibility my firm has to end users who are securing their life’s savings, their DAO treasuries, and their startups’ runway and how that is analogous to the responsibilities of this position. In my work, there is no punching out at the end of day: if an esoteric edge case with signing arises creating an issue for our users it means we need to stay up with them through the night to resolve the matter as quickly and efficiently as possible.I absolutely love what I do. I am lucky and thrilled to be contributing to the design and specification of our next device which will be my own dream hardware wallet, but I also think that anyone else looking to found a software or hardware wallet company is either crazy or oblivious to the gravity of the obligation they are taking on when securing their users’ crypto assets. It’s nerve-wracking. But it’s also deeply fulfilling when we hear from users thanking us for helping avoid losing funds. I know that in this role I will extend that same dedication and sense of responsibility to the Abitrum ecosystem that I do to our customers.The broader Ethereum ecosystem is very lucky to have a talented community of smart contract security professionals. I have basic coding proficiency, but I am not a software engineer - what I can bring to the table is specialized knowledge and experience that complements that skill set. Even among sophisticated developers, there is a major blind spot when it comes to comes to best practices for private key management and the very unsophisticated ways in which funds are frequently lost. I regularly have the unfortunate experience of talking to people who have lost a meaningful amount of money due to malicious actors in this space and am aware of the common attack vectors by which regular people are losing billions in crypto annually. There’s no more appealing target for bad actors than digital bearer assets which means there is a never-ending arms race between talented and creative bad actors and those trying to make crypto safer for everyone.All of the above is more of a narrative than a list of skills, but it demonstrates the value I can provide and the ways in which I meet the criteria outlined for the duties, values and practices desired in a Security Council member. I’m terminally online and on call for emergencies at all times. If highly specialized knowledge is required that the council does not have, I can act as a switchboard to connect us to the right resources at any time. I’m experienced with high stress crisis management situations including how to effectively and transparently communicate with impacted parties throughout that process. I am intimately familiar with best practices for responsible disclosures and I would relish in the chance to participate in security drills and flag day events. I am deeply familiar with best practices for opsec, internal controls, and maintaining the best possible security hygiene, and, of course, I will have no problem maintaining a dedicated hardware wallet for the purpose of carrying out my duties in this role.As someone who runs a company whose book club is currently plowing through Peter Gutmann’s Cryptographic Security Architecture: Design and Verification, when I heard about this role from a friend at Prysmatic Labs it seemed like a perfect fit.Thank you very much for reading through this wall of text and for your consideration. If I overlooked anything important please let me know in the comments - I’d be more than happy to answer any questions or elaborate further on any of the above."

For instance, if a critical security issue is reported privately to the Arbitrum Foundation, the Security Council assesses the situation. If necessary, they can approve an upgrade to fix the problem.Choosing the right council members is crucial to the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem due to the authority granted to them.Council Member ResponsibilitiesAll Security Council members are paid $5k in ARB per month and they are expected to fulfil the following responsibilities:Be Aligned: Uphold the Constitution of the ArbitrumDAO and have the Arbitrum ecosystem’s best interests at heartBe Diverse: Spread across geographies, time-zones, and organizations to add to the Security Council’s diversityHave Good OpSec: Prioritise operational security which includes, but not limited to, the use of a dedicated hardware wallet for this single roleBe Available: and contactable in case of an emergencyBe (Proactively) Engaged: with all other Security Council members when an action is necessary, and participate in security drills and flag day events organised by the Arbitrum FoundationHave Good Communication: Work with the Foundation to actively communicate the need for emergency and non-emergency actions when an issue is detected, and provide follow ups accordinglyBe Responsible: Document all actions and publish a transparency report after the emergency actions are completed, and maintain confidentiality of critical vulnerabilities and other sensitive information until the transparency report is publishedBe Competent: Independently assess, evaluate and understand a technical situation, as well as the respective solution and desired outcome, during an emergencyBe Reputable: Be experienced with emergencies and security incidents in the blockchain ecosystem (i.e. has been in ‘war rooms’, and knows how to communicate with confidentiality accordingly)Good (And Bad) Values and Practices of Security Council MembersA Good Member isA Good Member is notFamiliar, engaged, and aligned with the Arbitrum ecosystemSomeone who does not care about the success and future of Arbitrum, and has conflicts of interests that may impede their judgementAble to keep good operational security and operate a hardware wallet securely. Additionally, they are someone with good security hygiene and following best practicesOblivious to the responsibilities they carry, and are careless with hardware wallet security.Will voluntarily engage the other Security Council members when emergency / non-emergency actions are necessary, and aid the Foundation in documenting post-mortems and publish a full transparency report.Someone who exhibits free-rider behaviour, and does the bare minimum in emulating what the other Security Council members does.Willing to wake up 3am for a drill ensuring all members are reachable in case of an emergencyAway all year round and not engaging in practice runs and discussions with other council membersDeeply responsible for the security of ArbitrumOnly motivated by financial compensation, as this role comes with serious obligationsUnique in location, background and occupation (in comparison to other Security Council members)Similar to other Security Council membersAble to think critically and independently to understand what action the Security Council is taking, determine whether the proposed action will have the desired outcome, and critically assess whether this is a good idea (which requires both technical and non-technical judgement) - as there may be situations where there isn’t an obvious answerSomeone who does not come from a technical background, is unable to review code nor understand what they are signingThe character features above should be considered when casting your vote. After all, it is up to the Arbitrum community to vote for candidates who will will participate as a member in the Security Council member. It is critical to pick members who will act in good faith, think critically and independently, and perform their duties as a council member. A final judgement is not always about technical prowess, but willingness to take up the role and actively participate.Security Council Member AccountabilityAs outlined in the Arbitrum Constitution, there are two methods to remove a Security Council member if they fail to faithfully fulfil their role:At least 10% of all Votable Tokens have casted votes “in favor” of removal and at least 5/6 (83.33%) of all casted votes are “in favor” of removal;At least 9 of the Security Council members vote in favor of removal.Each member of the Security Council bears accountability not only to the Arbitrum DAO but, most significantly, to their fellow council members.Of course, the removal of a Security Council member is a publicly detectable event, and substantial public discourse should follow the removal of any members."

As well, I’m actively involved in helping Polygon’s Security Council and therefor very familiar with the do and the don’ts.I believe and love the idea that people from other similar projects are able to contribuite and collaborate in this way, given we all encounter similar issues. I absolutely only see this as a win-win and not a conflict of interest at all.ExperienceI’ve been in the security & engineering trenches for 20+ years doing every single area of Security, from incident response & pentesting, all they way to Global Leader of a 200+ Security Organization, working for top organizations such as IBM & ServiceNow, but as well involved in startups and entrepreneurs, and even been a multiple failed entrepreneur myself.Been involved web3 stuff since 2014 (if mining BTC can be called web3). I’m very confortable with reviewing transactions and its calldata, technical proposals and being able to raise risks and concerns.As well, I’ve participated in (more than I wished for) war rooms, disaster recovery activities, internal and external audits & assessments of all kind, and worked with most known Auditing firms in the space.Together with a fine eye for detail and operational excelence, I believe I can be a great asset to Arbitrum’s Security Council.You can find me talking about security at various conferences, once of the most recent ones (which have recording available) was ETH Amsterdam or ETHCC Paris in 2023:"

We have been involved in the web3 security scene in the past 2 years in lots of war rooms helping protocols to save significant funds during emergency times, notifying protocols about imminent threats in real-time and helping them with incident response as incidents happen. We go way back in the domain of vulnerability research and security in general. Prior to Hexagate, I was one of the first employees and an R&D manager of a very successful company in the healthcare security space, protecting healthcare networks globally in the globe from ransomware and other threats.Besides building the product, we have been very much involved in multiple initiatives and research that have significantly helped the ecosystem.We are an active member of the SEAL-911 group (https://securityalliance.org/) and Crypto ISAC, which helps with responsible vulnerability disclosure, incident response in times of emergency and contributing our knowledge and expertise in strategic discussions on how to build a more sustainable and secure crypto ecosystem.A few notable examples from the past:Helping Compound V2 following the Hundred Finance hack - we monitored the hack and researched the exploit and found out that all Compound V2 forks are susceptible to the same attack. We contacted Compound and OZ team and worked to communicate our findings: Hundred Finance Exploit and Compound v2 - Compound Community ForumResponsible vulnerability disclosure of a consensus bypass vulnerability on Polygon PoS and helping protect the bridge: Polygon Consensus Bypass Bugfix Review | by Immunefi | Immunefi | MediumHelping Socket right when we monitored the hack in real-time and notifying them to pause the bridge aggregator: Notion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.Helping WOOFi finance with their incident right when it happened: https://twitter.com/_WOOFi/status/1765150693176787261Helping Radiant in real-time when the hack happened and finding the root cause: https://twitter.com/hexagate_/status/1742868056848601474Helping Conic Finance before the hack and tracing funds after it happened: https://twitter.com/hexagate_/status/1683029772400484352and many other cases that we’ve been involved in.Our goal right from the beginning was to make web3 safe and secure.

It should be funded with enough ether to allow for you to pay for a transaction in Arbitrum One.If you are registering as an entity, there are additional non-exhaustive criteria that should be met, which can be viewed in the Security Council Elections 101.Register as a Candidate via TallyOne of the things that make the Security Council election on Arbitrum so exciting is that the entire election system is implemented as a suite of smart contracts.Anyone can register as a candidate via the smart contracts onchain. However, it is recommended that all interested candidates register for the election using Tally.Tally provides an easy-to-use user interface and it will record additional information that can be considered by voters before they cast their vote.Let’s walk through how to register step by step.Connect WalletThe first step is to visit the Security Council election website, click ‘Register as a candidate’ and connect your wallet.You will be asked to connect your wallet.Requirement: The connected wallet MUST be the same address that will be used for the Security Council election member.Please use an address that you are happy to link with your online identity.DeclarationsThe first step is to acknowledge a list of responsibilities to become a Security Council member alongside actions that you need to take before signing up.It is a good opportunity to evaluate whether you want to take on the responsibility the role entails and join the election.Profile SetupIf your connected wallet does not have a profile on Tally, then you will be asked to make a profile for the website. This profile is not exclusive to the Security Council elections and it can be reused for all activity on Tally. It is linked to your connected wallet.Candidacy DetailsAn opportunity to provide information to the voters and explain why you will make a great Security Council member. It covers your current role, technical experience, and geographical location.All voters will have access to this information (except for the email address) and they may use it to decide how to cast their vote.Conflict of interest: The Arbitrum Constitution states that a candidate cannot become a member of the Security Council if they have a conflict of interest. For example, affiliations with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others.Sign Message from EOATo ensure that you can produce signed messages for the different chains that the Security Council needs the ability to act on, you will need to sign a transaction from your address (Externally Owned Account).This also prevents instances where candidates might sign up for the elections using an onchain smart contract wallet which is not able to produce signatures valid for other ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.Preview & SubmitAfter expressing your readiness to shoulder the responsibility, you have one final opportunity to review the candidacy details before officially registering for the election.The final step is to click ‘Submit’.You will need to authorise a transaction to submit registration details to the onchain smart contract.The Ethereum address that will join the Security Council will need ETH to pay for the transaction fee.It must be sent by the same address as the smart contract relies on msg.sender for authentication.Only the Ethereum address is stored onchain and all candidacy details are kept off-chain.Thank you for taking an interest in protecting the Arbitrum ecosystem and good luck in the elections For any questions, please reach out to the DAO Relations Team (@Cliffton.eth or @Raam) or the Security Council email (scelection@arbitrum.foundation)."

It allows any project to deploy their own customized version of the Arbitrum technology stack. L3s that settle to Arbitrum One and Nova already are and remain free and permissionless to use and customize. Today’s announcement makes it easier than ever to launch custom Arbitrum L2s that settle directly to Ethereum as well as Arbitrum L3s on top of other non-Arbitrum chains.There are only two key requirements for participation in the Arbitrum Expansion Program, aimed at ensuring alignment with both Ethereum and the Arbitrum DAO. First, participants are expected to contribute a portion of their profits back to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Second, the deployment of the rollup must be exclusive to Ethereum or any chain that derives its security from Ethereum.Via the permissionless revenue sharing model of the Program, Orbit chains are free to customize L2s or L3s that settle to Ethereum, including on top of non-Arbitrum chains!  L3s that settle to Arbitrum One and Nova are still covered by the existing free, permissionless path.0124_OrbitChainHierarchy_Infographics_R5a1600×900 295 KBThe Program provides support for teams looking to highly customize their chain configuration, including dedicated blockchain space, custom gas token, native account abstraction, alternative data availability layer choices, and potential future services from the Arbitrum community. Aside from the built-in customization options, Orbit developers are free to customize the code in any way they see fit.A differentiating feature of Arbitrum Orbit is that the chains retain full control of their governance  and will not be required to outsource their governance or share governance with other chains and ecosystems. Teams building with Orbit have freedom to customize and innovate however they see fit.While L3s that settle to Arbitrum One or Nova will not be required to share revenue with the Arbitrum DAO, L2s as well as L3s on top of other chains will have to share a portion of their revenue. Part of the contributed revenue will go to a newly established Arbitrum Developer Guild, a new initiative to help fund core Arbitrum development and attract the best development teams to contribute to the Arbitrum tech stack.L2s and L3s with infinite possibilities – customize Orbit to your needs!The demand for rollups as a foundational technology stack is rapidly increasing. Projects are eager to modify the Arbitrum stack according to their business needs and run their own instance of the Orbit software. The Orbit deployment tool comes built-in with a host of customization options, and developers can go even deeper than that and use the codebase to make deep customizations…Not every project needs their own chain, and indeed for many applications, launching on Arbitrum One or Nova is the ideal choice. But there are several compelling reasons that make a custom chain a great choice for many projects, and Arbitrum Orbit is a flexible solution that can meet the needs of any project looking to build their own chain in the Ethereum ecosystem:Dedicated blockspace. Gain independence from chain usage by other applicationsCustom gas token. Choose which token is used for chain fees allowing you to create native economies and utility incentivesNative account abstraction. Go beyond Ethereum’s account abstractionAlternative data availability layer choices. AnyTrust, Celestia, and more data availability solutions are already integrated into Arbiturm OrbitNo governance constraints. Control your own destiny; no need to submit to shared governanceArbitrum Orbit has already been adopted by dozens of teams, but with the introduction of the Expansion Program, all of Orbit’s capabilities are now easily accessible to teams wanting to make a custom L2 that settles directly to Ethereum, or even build an L3 on top of a non-Arbitrum chain that settles to Ethereum. Teams wishing to create an L3 that settles to Arbitrum One are still covered by the existing, free, permissionless model.We are actively researching and developing best in class interoperability solutions for Orbit chains, and we expect to see many live Orbit chains that can easily interact for one unified Ethereum experience.Why was the Arbitrum Expansion Program created? What are the benefits and requirements?Prior to the Expansion Program, developers that were interested in deploying their own Arbitrum technology chain could choose one of three paths: (1) build their chain as an  L3 that settles to Arbitrum One or Nova, which was and remains  a permissionless activity  (2) If they wanted to build an L2 then they could  ask the Arbitrum DAO to issue  a software license using the Arbitrum DAO’s governance system or (3) negotiate terms with the Arbitrum Foundation (Offchain Labs also maintains the right to issue licenses but has preferred to allow the community to steer this process to date).  While the process worked well for those looking to build L3s, the latter options were cumbersome and high-touch for those looking to build L2s. With the growing demand for Arbitrum Orbit chains of all types, it became clear that the community needed an efficient process for launching chains that also aligns with Etherem and the Arbitrum DAO.The Arbitrum Expansion Program streamlines this via a self-service model that fosters incentive alignment amongst all parties including contributors, community members, ecosystem projects and the newly deployed rollups. It focuses on:Permissionless adoption. Anyone can adopt the technology stack and modify it according to their project’s requirements.Ethereum alignment. All deployments must ultimately settle on top of Ethereum or a chain whose integrity is secured by Ethereum.Value accrual. Automatically contributes a portion of the chain’s revenue back to the Arbitrum DAO and to a new Arbitrum Developer Guild fund for contributors to the Arbitrum codebase.Community enablement. Additional community-run features, alongside the software license, that will act as a supportive cornerstone for projects that adopt the Arbitrum technology stack.Freedom to innovate. There is no limitation on how a chain governs itself such as a requirement to submit to shared governance or other similar constraining structures.First and foremost, the Expansion Program includes a software license that allows anyone to freely modify the code with changes required for their project. Possible customizations include choosing which data availability layer to use, the ability to experiment with sequencer environments and MEV frameworks,  integrating entirely new virtual machines (like Arbitrum Stylus), and so much more!.All Orbit deployments must rely on Ethereum for settlement and adhere to the Arbitrum Constitution’s community value of being Ethereum aligned. This requires that the deployment has its security depend on the Ethereum blockchain, and by way of example, intends to include optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, optimiums and validiums that settle to Ethereum.The motivation is to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem by making Arbitrum’s best-in-class technology available to any team that wants to launch an L2 or L3 in the Ethereum ecosystem.The Arbitrum technology stack will be implemented, and should be configured to, automatically share a portion of the chain revenue back. This feature is not currently live in production, but is being worked on, and we hope to release it shortly. All users of the Arbitrum Expansion Program will pay the same percentage, which is computed only on the chain’s sequencer profit (inclusive of its MEV strategies). The initial percentage is set at 10% (which will be received by a wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation), and once compliance checks have been completed, subsequently rerouted with 8% being distributed to the ArbitrumDAO and the remaining 2% to a special developer fund, the Arbitrum Developer Guild, for contributors to the codebase.What is the mission of the Arbitrum Developer Guild?The Guild is being created to incentivize and grow the set of  core developers building the Arbitrum technology.  Only once  the Guild membership has expanded will the funds be appropriately distributed amongst its members. We will be sharing more information about and how to get involved in the Arbitrum Developer Guild in the near future, and interested teams are encouraged to reach out.What’s the future vision for the Arbitrum Expansion Program?Arbitrum Orbit chains will benefit from the already announced upcoming technical upgrades such as Stylus and Bold. We further anticipate that the Expansion Program can be extended over time to include additional opt-in benefits which may include new technical features like automatic smart contract upgrades and a global pause feature by Arbitrum’s security council, as well as non-technical benefits such as eligibility to participate in other programs run by the ArbitrumDAO. The Expansion Program should be viewed as an evolving package of features that will be made available for projects adopting the Arbitrum technology stack giving them access to a broad range of technical features and ecosystem initiatives.If the Expansion Program is successful, this approach can provide a new project seeking to use the Arbitrum technology stack the best of both worlds: independence to tailor the software to meet specific business needs while benefiting from extensive support from the Arbitrum community.The full details of the Arbitrum Expansion Program Terms of Use can be found here."

It does not commit the DAO to work with any of the current contributors in the management of the structure beyond its establishment.That being said, we are working under the explicit commitment to produce a proposal under which the team will be available to work full time, exclusively for Arbitrum, in managing the developed mandate or parts of it.About the AVI PilotThe primary output of the pilot will be a market-based ecosystem investment thesis aimed to enable Arbitrum to develop a best-in-class approach to a DAO-led Ecosystem Investment Fund. The thesis provide a proposal for how it should be structured and deployed.This will be supported by:Rigorous understanding of Arbitrum environmentRecommendations aligned with Arbitrum’s long term goalsDeveloping an Ops plan for applying the Ecosystem Investment Thesis, Strategy, and Recommendations on next stepsCommunity engagement for DAO accountability and transparencyHow to get involvedSeveral DAO contributors and service providers, including RnDAO, EVM Capital, Elixir, and Areta, are already contributing this initiative. This effort builds upon the work of key delegates who have been proponents of ventures in Arbitrum, such as Coinflip and Krzstf, and on efforts by the GCP and the Arbitrum Foundation. Additionally, the DAO’s best interest is also being represented by Alex Lumley who has been a key contributor since the beginning of the initiative during GovHack Denver.If you would like to get more involved or consulted as part of the discovery interviews and delegate conversations, please reach out via a DM or reply on the forum here.And bookmark this thread for fortnightly updates.Market ConsultationWe are also in the process of recruiting the participants for the Market Consultation which is a key part of the first phase.

That said, we think it is important to start seeking feedback as soon as possible. Following extensive conversations with key stakeholders and active delegates, we’ve strived to distill their thoughts and ideas into a cohesive vision for the Arbitrum DAO, presented below.[Arbitrum’s Vision is] to accelerate the universal shift onchain by empowering the freedom to advance scalable, secure, and trust-minimized applications.[Arbitrum’s Mission is] to bring secure, compelling, and full-featured rollups to the masses.Arbitrum is in the midst of a hyper-growth phase. In 5 years, Arbitrum should be:An expansive ecosystem of Orbit chains distributing high-quality blockspace through the Arbitrum tech stack. Every Orbit chain extends a unified Arbitrum brand.An incubator that fosters native application and infrastructure development with Arbitrum One, becoming the most sought-after blockspace in crypto across a diverse range of verticals.An ARB token recognized by the market as a result of value accrual from various sources in order to enhance rollup security.Home to crypto’s most popular apps, many of which use Stylus as a mission-critical component to their codebase.A strategic resource allocator capitalizing on Arbitrum’s growth by investing in infrastructure and applications that capture value in the ecosystem.The premier tech suite providing flexibility and freedom to builders through features such as Timeboost, BoLD, custom gas tokens, sovereign governance, Stylus, and more.Governed by the most robust DAO with aligned, active, sophisticated, and diverse delegates helping drive the ecosystem forward.Supported by a sustainable, revenue-generating DAO with multi-faceted programs and efficient operational structures.Committed to extending Ethereum’s values. Arbitrum is the default destination  for users to interact with genuinely decentralized, trust-minimized technologies.A household name with recognition on par with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Arbitrum is the gateway to Ethereum for new users from other chains and the real world.In March 2023, the Arbitrum DAO was born with the launch of the ARB governance token. One of the largest and most widespread airdrops to date, the ARB token was distributed to over 580,000 unique addresses and 137 applications built on Arbitrum One. This moment marked a historic achievement, giving decentralized governance full control over all aspects of the execution environment; a pivotal step in the quest to scale Ethereum.Over the past 15 months, tremendous progress has been made. Core developers announced the completion of Timeboost, Stylus, and BoLD. The Arbitrum Foundation quickly scaled to a team of over 30 contributors, and the Arbitrum DAO launched multiple grant programs, incentive initiatives, and investment ventures. Yet, one clear hole has emerged in the DAO, a lack of alignment on our objectives. When posed with the question, “What will Arbitrum look like in 5 years?”, it’s likely that developers, the Foundation, and the DAO’s many contributors would provide diverse answers. While Arbitrum’s bottom-up nature is one of its strengths, we now recognize the need for a unified vision—a north star to guide us. Additionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies.Today, each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise like should my organization work toward operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset? Growth of Orbit? Growth of Stylus? Growth of Arbitrum one? Public Goods? etc. With a lack of visible direction, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Additionally, the absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to facilitate oversight and accountability. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge “did this organization work hard” but lacks the ability to judge “did this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward?”Arbitrum has always embraced the principle that the technology should speak for itself. As the largest layer-2 solution by nearly every metric, and the major rollup closest to reaching Stage 2, Arbitrum represents more than just outstanding tech. Arbitrum embodies Freedom:Orbit Chains: Applications can now create their own fully customizable blockspace. Orbit chains act as Web3 servers tapping into the underlying liquidity and user base of Arbitrum One or any other chain.Stylus: Provides the freedom to leverage the efficiencies of Rust, C, and C++ to write smart contracts without losing EVM compatibility.Timeboost: A new transaction ordering policy with an express lane auction system that generates revenue for the DAO without hindering UX.Ultimately, Arbitrum offers permissionless access to the best scaling tech stack in crypto, allowing any user, developer, or individual to build and interact with trust-minimized technologies in seconds.Our Guiding Principles Thus FarSince its creation, the Arbitrum DAO has been governed by its Constitution and seven community values:Ethereum-aligned: Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and communitySustainable: Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gainsSecure: Arbitrum is security mindedSocially inclusive: Open and welcoming to all constructive participantsTechnically inclusive: Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technologyUser-focused: Managed for the benefit of all usersNeutral and open: Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competitionThese values have guided us thus far, but it is time to align on a grander vision. What is Arbitrum’s north star? What are the ecosystem and its numerous contributors (the DAO and its programs, Foundation, and development teams) working towards?We have done our best with this first draft to align what we believe many key contributors think of as the DAO’s vision, mission, and goals, but we must solicit more community feedback and iterate before moving forward."

Another upcoming feature will be proposal evolution, so readers can easily follow the lifecycle of proposals, from discussions to onchain vote.I’d love to hear any other Arbitrum specific challenges that we could try to crack. E.g. in the previous STIP applications, there were so many that it was difficult to process all of them consistently. Another could be that developers may be confused as to where they should start… stylus, orbit, nova, one…? What would you like to see solved?As a quick overview for those that don’t know what x23.ai does, we:Aggregate forum, snapshot, github, and official dataUse AI and LLMs to condense and bring more understanding to the dataThe results are a newsfeed, summarised articles, instant search, and a chat bot.I made a video to showcase these features for the community here: https://youtu.be/BsGXSn-tkYUThe custom Arbitrum chatbot we just soft launched on Telegram here and i think it works rather well.

Another ","Web3 Grant Program Research and AnalysisOverviewThis report provides an in-depth exploration of Web3 grant programs, analyzing them from various angles to understand their best practices, effectiveness, development, and overall impact. Our research examines best practices, methods for measuring program success, and the development of a maturity framework for grant programs in this space. Additionally, we outline key impact metrics based on insights from a range of Web3 grant programs. Another aim of this study is to identify opportunities to improve reputation systems within these programs.To inform our analysis, we conducted interviews with grant program operators, engaged with forums across the ecosystem, and revisited key findings from the Grant Innovation Lab’s State of Web3 Grants report, along with other retrospective studies. Drawing from this data, we developed several tools: a framework to evaluate program effectiveness, a maturity model to assess different stages of grant programs, and a set of metrics to gauge impact. We advise operators to use these tools in combination for a more comprehensive assessment of program outcomes.It’s important to acknowledge that grant programs in the Web3 space are still experimental by nature. The entire industry is in a state of evolution, and grant programs have had to adapt accordingly. Even the most advanced programs, often in their 5th or 6th iteration, are still relatively young. Therefore, we don’t recommend directly comparing them with long-established grant initiatives and programs outside of Web3.Finally, this study is empirical, shaped by the realities of a fast-evolving industry, but it is also data-driven, incorporating our deep dives and analysis from a wide range of grant programs. Our hope is that the insights provided here will be valuable to the wider ecosystem, supporting the continued development of effective and impactful grant programs in Web3.TeamZER8: Solo managed grant programs for Thankarb Milestone 1 and distributed over 500k $, Ex- eligibility team lead at Gitcoin DAO: reviewed over 3000 grant applications and helped save over 1m$.

There are several factors that can contribute to this such as:Inability to measure and track grantee progressLack of reporting from granteesInability to measure grantee sustainabilityFor programs that don’t define categories, comparison of grantees can be difficult if grantees projects are incomparable in natureGrant farmingCrafting good RFPs, especially technical ones, is tough. Proper assessment takes resources.Manual due diligence takes time and resources. Even tougher to do at scale.Coordination between programs to sift out grant farmersGrantees want free money without any expectations for milestones or deliverablesFinding quality applicants for programs with large applicant volumes is tough.Decentralizing to a community is tricky if the decision-making group does not have the relevant expertise. Another challenge specific to grants programs run by DAOs is it’s tough to coordinate with a larger DAO.Staying up to date with a large portfolio of grantees is also tough.Solutions and Best PracticesConsistent Reporting - monthly reporting and a regular cadence with consistency is an excellent way to be transparent, and to communicate updates with the larger community. Aave Grants DAO (AGD) is a good example where they share overall metrics such as:Total Grant Applications ReceivedTotal Applications ApprovedAcceptance RatePercentage of projects that make it to the written stage and video call stageTotal Amount DisbursedPercentage of Complete Grant PaymentsPercentage of In-progress/Incomplete Grant Payments:Status of all grants (percentage of complete, in-progress, and inactive or sunset)Amount and Quantity Approved by CategoryA summary of the grantees each month, along with how much they were awarded, and a brief description of their grant.The transparency in the evaluation process and criteria helps limit duplicate proposals and help applicants know what they need to improve in order to receive a grant in the first place.Having different grants formats and flavors for different types of grants is an effective way to deploy capital and to run grants experiments.Being adaptable and flexible with changing needs of the program and of the industry is a good practice that prevents the program from being outdated and ineffective.A way to improve the quality of applications is to outline the nature of the application process, making it easier for grantees to apply. An example of this is Uniswap Foundation, whose website includes a checklist for potential applicants as well as tips and considerations to help applicants strengthen their submission.Learnings from Grants Programs, Operators, and L2sThe following insights were derived from a variety of ecosystems by combing through governance forum retrospectives and insights, as well as direct interviews with several operators and grants tools, and leadership from these projects.Learnings from AGD (Aave Grants DAO) Grants ProgramProgram OverviewAave Grants DAO (AGD) was a community-led grants program that fosters community growth and innovation in the Aave ecosystem by serving as a gateway for teams building on top of Aave Pools or with GHO. It was started in 2021 and announced winding down in 2024.Insights from the AGD forumEstablishing a legal entity allows a DAO to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with traditional industries.“Introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers allows for further involvement of the community while also bringing expertise from different community members.”“A well functioning grants team only works well if the team is nimble, can move fast, and act independently”.“Term elections for choosing capital allocators from the community is a well-established norm in various reputed ecosystems such as ENS DAO, Gitcoin etc. By implementing a more rigorous and clearly defined set of criteria for selection, an election process would offer a fair and unbiased chance for community members, including those who are new contributors and proposers, to join the AGD team and contribute meaningfully to the DAO”.“A transparent process empowers the community to keep on oversight on what proposals are getting accepted, rejected, funded and get a deeper insight into the review parameters and process…A transparent process will empower the community to ask the right questions and allow for constructive feedback, thus improving further iterations of AGD. Additional deliberation and community participation is better than having none.”Grantee growth parameters should be objective and tied to tangible value creation to better evaluate the performance of the grants program.Insights from the AGD Operations TeamThe ecosystem: stage of protocol, contributor maturity, developer interest/awareness - are really important factors for structuring and setting up a grants program. Giving one size fits all advice for grants programs is difficult. Grants programs should start with their mission/goals/values and then work backwards to design and implement a program to best serve thatRotating committee: This is also something AGD explored. Reviewers need to be trusted and recognized by the community is crucial - unless the program is set up with direct community involvement it’s pretty necessary for a community to trust a grants team.A well functioning grants team…: Being able to grow and evolve as a grants program alongside the respective ecosystem is key. Grants programs should complement the other stakeholders, not be a totally independent island.Elections: This was actually brought up to the community and was shut down because it’s hard not to make something like elections a popularity contest. It’s tough though because the surface level appeal is clear, however there’s skepticism on whether it would result in getting the best people in the role. To the point above, especially having people who are independent seems difficult if elections are heavily leaned on. A (main?) priority of reviewers becomes reelection in cases like this.“Additional deliberation and community participation is better than none”: The program mission and even on a per grant basis has a huge influence on this. If the goal is contributor growth and the ecosystem is relatively unknown then taking long times to review and engage the community on each grant doesn’t scale and the process does more harm than good. Additionally, there may not be much of a community to engage early on.Learnings from ThankArbitrum (Arbitrum DAO) Grants ProgramProgram OverviewThank Arbitrum is the first pluralist grants program under Arbitrum and has committed to allocating $3.2M in ARB through 10 grants programs to the top crypto builders and contributors. For this study, we’ve researched ThankARB’s Milestone 1 Program. ThankArbitrum can be seen as a multi-dimensional grant framework and a learning machine that evolves from iteration to iteration based on the inputs, learnings, and outputs of each iteration.Insights from the Thank ARB Milestone 1 report in the Arbitrum Forum:LegitimacyThe Thank ARB strategic priorities found during #GovMonth-an initiative to reward people that want to help shape governance, did not receive support from top delegates because they did not include them in the process in a way that was seen as legitimate.Without legitimate priorities and processes it is hard for the DAO to enable more experimentation.CommunicationCommunicating the results of a multi-dimensional grant framework is a complex task. Segmenting by persona (delegate/builder/grantee/etc) could be a solutionDAO members need communications to be simplified and aggregated. They’re unsure of where to go for maintaining context, knowing about responsibilities and potential roles as a DAO member, and learning about other ways to become a good Arbitrum citizen.OrganizationPotential contributors need a pathway to get a small grant to do narrow scoped work which then is assessed to provide next steps for the contributor to know there is opportunity and also for the DAO to double down on high performersThe community is willing and capable however they’re unsure of what to do next.Evaluation and organization of 13 grant programs makes for extreme complexity. A potential route to tackling this is with focused workstreams.ExperimentationQuadratic funding is likely not a good meta-allocation mechanism. Exploring options with Quadratic Voting and other custom algorithms could be better alternatives.Successful tools usually solve more than one problem.For example: Hats protocol provides many solutions from workstream accountability to dynamic councils. Hedgey streams are easy to use and can work for grants as well as salaries.When finding solutions, it’s useful to understand context and to think through other ways the tools or solution can be used in the ecosystem.The DAO needs more indexed data available for the community to interpret. Overall, the DAO does not have any agreed upon metrics to give definitive answers about what success looks like.Funding SuccessThere have been lots of learnings with the foundation through compliance, processes, and systems implemented and funded within the ecosystem.As decisions are made, they are observing and documenting criteria to open up the process in the future. Confirming community-led review capabilities is a priority before removing decision making power in the DAO. This applies at the framework level as multiple programs are attempting to draft and use criteria-based approaches.Firestarters program served a clear purpose and was the most successful program (as perceived by the DAO because it drove tangible results for the DAO in a short time.Arbitrum partnered with legacy organizations such as the American Cancer Society, Blackrock Franklin Templeton signifying important achievements.Data driven funding will be critical in Milestone 2 (STIP support, OSO, etc)Learnings from ThankARB ML1 ProgramsThank Arbitrum is a plural grant framework which involves multiple separate grant programs, this implies they each have to report separately.List of programs with amounts funded:Program NameAmountThank ARB350,000 ARBFirestarters300,000 ARBMEV Research330,000 ARBAribitrum’s “Biggest Small Grants Yet”90,000 ARBArbitrum Co.

Below we have presented the learnings from these grant programs:1. Arbitrum Matching FestProgram Description: This program added extra funds to the matching pool for quadratic funding rounds on Arbitrum. Top programs running on Arbitrum were selected to receive additional funding.Why the Program Was FundedThis program was designed to:Make an agreement with Gitcoin to prioritize deployment of Allo protocol on Arbitrum and integration to the Grant Stack interface.Attract new audiences to Arbitrum via Gitcoin which may find a home on Arbitrum or generate transaction feesMarket Arbitrum in a positive way in the Web 3 communityTakeaways:Partnering with a legacy health organization (American Cancer Society) turned out to be a great move, bringing in a lot of positive attention and significant marketing benefits.Arbitrum could potentially handle all the main rounds on its own, given that it successfully hosted nearly half the rounds on Gitcoin.Many of the organizations involved, like Metagov and TEC, had little to no prior experience with Arbitrum, yet they were successful in bringing their donor bases to Arbitrum for these rounds.2. FirestartersProgram Description: The Firestarter program was designed to address specific and immediate needs within the DAO. Problems as identified by delegates and Plurality Labs (acquired by Thrive Protocol) were given a grant to do the initial catherding and research that is required to kickstart action.Expected OutcomesQuickly and effectively address urgent needs resulting in high-quality resolutions.Demonstrate the ability to create fast and fair outcomes that benefit the ecosystem.Frameworks for service providers to build a scalable foundation for Arbitrum growth.High quality resolution of key, immediate needs. better, more fair outcomes for the ecosystem, more fair frameworks for service providers speed and fairness.Takeaways:This program was well received and has significant positive impact because it directly addressed needs the community recognized.Firestarters need a clear next step rather than expecting indefinite continuation. The need for on-chain tools to assign roles for igniting and holding firestarters accountable stood out.While giving someone like Disruption Joe decision-making power worked, it’s worth exploring other models that would function well without relying on a single individual.3. Thank ArbitrumProgram Description: This program introduced a novel way for the community to connect with the DAO. It provided a foundation for the community to continually sense and respond to the fast-paced crypto environment. Its aim was to provide a place for DAO members to learn about what is happening, to voice their opinions, and to learn about opportunities to offer their skills to Arbitrum.Expected OutcomesImprove how grant funding is distributedIncrease delegate and community confidence that funds are allocated as intended based on a collaborative process.Assure the community that we can manage the grant process inclusively and efficiently.Takeaways:Despite efforts to remove sybils, they struggled with engagement from participants who weren’t genuinely invested in the DAO. Future efforts should focus more on engaging delegates and valuable contributors.While significant data was gathered on how token holders feel, it didn’t fully reflect the disengagement among delegates.The need to develop better interfaces tailored to DAO members’ needs.The initial attempt at a tARB reputation system didn’t work as planned. Discussions with Hats Protocol revealed that dynamic councils based on Thank ARB contributions could enhance decision-making, particularly for tasks requiring a high level of effort, similar to what’s needed in Optimism’s appeal system.4. MEV (Miner Extractable Value) ResearchProgram Description: This grant was awarded to establish the Plural Research Society and build the first forum and plural voting tools needed to support it. As part of the grant, an experimental plural research workshop would be hosted where the participants – researchers from across the MEV space – would convene to present their research proposals, discuss and debate using a variety of pluralistic tools, then ultimately vote to decide how to allocate 100,000 ARB in grant funding.Why the Program Was FundedThis program was designed to :Create a scalable platform to build upon a successful proof of concept built for ZuzaluLeverage the expertise of highly respected advisors to conduct novel researchDiscover if a better forum can drastically improve the quality of conversationUse the forum under-the-hood design to allocate funding on a niche, high-expertise topicTo ensure platforming for a broad selection of researcher opinions in the gas fee optimization and MEV space which has incentives to platform only financially beneficial viewsExpected OutcomesA new forum dedicated to high expertise discussions, pushing the boundaries of decentralized governance and credibility.The forum will be a place where qualified voices and thought leaders stand out and the most important discussion gets attention in a decentralized way.Radically amplify new ideas and technology.TakeawaysHaving a dedicated, high-quality advisor who is truly invested in the project made a big difference in attracting top talent and ensuring adherence to specs.Some viewed the program as merely a “forum” or “conference,” but it’s actually a critical experiment aimed at improving our understanding of gas fee optimization and information sharing in the ecosystem.Due to delays in compliance, assembling the right team, and coordinating schedules for researchers, this program has taken longer than others, with more insights expected as it progresses.5. Arbitrum Co.Lab by RNDAOProgram DescriptionRnDAO designed a programme to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem through a research fellowship focused on governance and operations challenges, with the goal of incubating sustainable Collaboration Tech ventures that build on Arbitrum. The ventures operate as a “business cluster” creating network effects to attract others through integrations, talent, investor networks, etc.Why the Program Was FundedThis program was funded to:Explore proven methods of deliberation in a web 3 context such as citizen’s assemblies or sociacracy 3.0Explore AI solutions to automate components of DAO contributor experience and/or governance designProvide a support network for researchers along with a pathway to future funding.Takeaways:Ways of tracking applicants who aren’t selected but remain enthusiastic about Arbitrum are required and exploredA more clear definition of the research topics for the participants would have ensured more targeted outcomes.Program is still ongoing so learnings are still being observed.6. Plurality Gov BoostProgram DescriptionThis program included direct grants funded to increase Arbitrum DAO ability to effectively govern its resources.Why the Program Was FundedThis program was designed to:Utilize PL delegated decision-making freedom to use different decision making modalities to fund needed workFund research and milestone based work using milestone based payouts.Anticipate future needs of the DAO and build, processes, procedures, and programs which may have substantial impact on the DAO but lack other ways of being funded.Takeaways:The program highlighted the need for clearer decision-making pathways and transparency, especially for specialized requirements.Some decisions were made based on expert input that wasn’t widely understood by others. For example, Helika Gaming’s data was crucial for analyzing acquisition costs across different verticals, which will save the DAO significant funds over time, even if these choices weren’t always clear to everyone.7. Questbook Rounds on GitcoinProgram DescriptionThis program started with two unique governance experiments. A “domain allocation” governance experiment allowed the community to direct funds to four matching pools based on Questbook program domains. Then 4 quadratic funding rounds sourced grants to assist their domain allocators in sourcing grants.Why the Program Was FundedThis program was designed to:Support Questbook program success based on them answering that the “reason they would not succeed if they didn’t”Show how pluralist programs can be complementary to each other.Takeaways:The disparity between votes in the domain round and funding round, especially in categories like Gaming, suggests that Quadratic Funding might not be the best method for all cases.The true success of this program will be evident in how many projects receive additional funding after it ends. This will be most telling if the initial allocation isn’t fully used.Offering a small ARB incentive for donations over $10 could nearly double the average donation amount on the Thank ARB platform.8. Arbitrum Citizens Retro FundingProgram DescriptionThe goal of this program was to distribute 100k $ARB to best Arbinauts and citizens that have proactively worked and truly impacted the Arbitrum DAO since its launch. They aimed to reward work that helped kickstart the DAO and/or contributed directly to Arbitrums strategic goals.Why the Program was FundedThis program was designed to:Reward DAO contributors who had stepped up to contribute without reward since the DAO startedEncourage future participation by setting a precedent for retroactive rewardsExperiment with using Quadratic Funding retroactivelyMarket the Arbitrum community in a highly visible wayTakeaways:By focusing only on individuals, certain organizations that have made significant contributions were not able to participate. Involving delegates in creating eligibility criteria could help address this.A dynamic pot size might be worth considering in future rounds to ensure higher participation.9. Allo on Arbitrum HackathonProgram DescriptionThis program was all about expanding what Gitcoin’s Allo protocol could do on the Arbitrum One Network. New funding strategies, interfaces, and curation modules were available for all 490 protocols on Arbitrum to use freely to fund what matters.Why the Program Was FundedThis program was designed to :Enable new on-chain allocation strategies and interfaces which can be used by all 500+ protocols building on ArbitrumSupport more projects to exist on the Allo protocol project registry to create consistent open data standards for future community review and evaluationDiscover new grant evaluation interfaces and mechanismsSupport more decision making modalities to be available for use and testing in Thank ARB governance and potentially for Arbitrum DAO governance if successful.Takeaways:It’s crucial to clearly communicate the judging mechanism from the start. Even if the judging happens at the end, sticking to announced prize amounts is key to maintaining trust.A lack of clarity via eligibility led to some undesirable situations, which were fortunately resolved through direct conversations with the teams involved.Learnings from ThankARB leadershipWeb3 grants are decentralized resource allocation mechanisms, broader than traditional grants, and designed to address ecosystem needs. These grants foster innovation, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth through decentralized decision-making.ThankArb functions as a learning machine, iterating and improving with each funding round. Its focus on adaptability allows it to identify and expand successful mechanisms, decentralizing decision-making by empowering competent individuals.The future of Web3 grants also involves refining decentralized funding mechanisms, such as quadratic funding (QF) possibly paired together with other onchain allocation mechanisms eg:conviction voting (CV), but even more important is applying tailored solutions that address crucial ecosystem needs., eg: direct funding, councils, etc . Experimentation with off and on-chain resource allocation remains critical.Notable programs include ThankArb and ThankApe (ApeCoin community), both of which emphasize strong community-building before allocating grants. Iterative learning and adaptability make these programs stand out.A natural comparison would be to look at RPGF vs ThankARB as they both serve as the main allocators for L2 ecosystems(Optimism and Arbitrum), but in reality ThankArb and Optimism RPGF1 serve distinct roles, with ThankArb focusing on decentralized allocation and RPGF1 on centralized decision-making. Success in both can be measured through ecosystem impact and milestone achievementKey best practices include:Ecosystem Needs: Tailoring grants to the ecosystem’s specific requirements.Multiple Pathways: Offering diverse funding mechanisms for different projects, protocols, etcIterative Learning: Running experiments to refine grant strategies and address evolving needs.Grant program effectiveness can be assessed through metrics such as milestone achievements, impact on ecosystem needs, and efficiency in resource distribution. Allocators must play a proactive role in managing and growing projects.While Web3 aims for decentralization, most grant programs are still centralized in decision-making. Programs like ThankArb are pushing the boundaries by experimenting with on-chain mechanisms to distribute decision-making power more effectively.Learnings from Karma GAPAbout GAP:The Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP) is a tool designed to address grants funding challenges by aiding grantees in building their reputation, assisting communities in maintaining grantee accountability, and enabling third parties to develop applications using this protocol.TakeawaysEffective grant programs should have clear goals, transparent evaluation rubrics, and involve the community in decision-making. A maturity index can rate programs based on factors like financial sustainability and community support. Feedback and marketing assistance are also important for successful grant programsArticulating what an operator wants out of the grants program is crucial. This can help set the tone and guide the latter process of applications, grantee selection, and evaluation later on.Having a rubric to evaluate the application from is also especially useful. This allows applicants to understand reasons for decision-making.Having some form of feedback, even if generalized feedback is helpful to applicants, and is taking an extra step that can improve the process.Post-funding support is an area most programs fall short in. Following up with grantees and collaborating or sharing feedback where useful, and amplifying and providing marketing support to grantees can go a long way in the grantee journey.Learnings from Optimism RPGF 3 and 4About Retroactive Public Goods Funding Rounds:RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) is a mechanism that rewards public goods based on proven impact.Retro Funding is being run as an ongoing experiment where insights and learnings from each round feed the next iteration of the program and inform the design of future experiments.Takeaways“Having standardized, verifiable, and comparable impact metrics is crucial to objectively measure the impact of applications.Having stronger eligibility criteria results in less spammy applications.Applications for funding can be shortened, as deadlines are the real driver of submissionsDefined grants rounds set the stage for a more focused and impactful approach to incentivizing contributionsThe broad round scope overwhelmed badgeholders and applicants.The absence of standardized, verifiable, and comparable impact metrics, and the reliance on individual subjective review criteria, made it difficult to objectively measure the impact of applications.The self-selection of applications to review by badgeholders did not ensure a fair review by a minimum number of badgeholders of each application.The sheer volume of applications, combined with weak eligibility criteria, complicated the voting process for badgeholders. Lists were not effective in scaling the ability of badgeholders to accurately vote on more applications.These learnings were derived from 300+ crowdsourced pieces of feedback, collected via a survey among badgeholders, the RetroPGF 3 feedback Gov Forum post, as well as the badgeholder Discord/Telegram channel and will inform the next iteration of Retro Funding.Below we document these learnings in detail as part of a gradual process to open source Optimism governance design. This post is non-exhaustive and aims to focus on the core learnings and most popular requests.”.Learnings from the RPGF TeamGrants in Web3 are designed to support future innovations and projects by providing funding based on anticipated impact. Programs like RetroPGF (RPGF) offer rewards for past achievements, contrasting with traditional grants that focus on future outcomes.TakeawaysOptimism’s approach includes rewarding ecosystem impact through grants, with a commitment from the Collective to recognize and compensate valuable contributions. Optimism aims to transition towards a fully on-chain grant system as the social layer and metrics become more integrated with proper attestation mechanisms.The future of Web3 grants involves transitioning to more on-chain systems, improving transparency, and creating more sustainable models. This includes developing grant systems that can effectively measure and reward impact over time, rather than just focusing on short-term growth.Top grant programs, such as RPGF and the Grants Council, vary in their approach. RPGF has a larger budget and compensates for past impact, while the Grants Council emphasizes a high standard of professionalism. Different programs may have different strengths depending on their focus and metrics.The effectiveness of a grant program depends on its goals and metrics. RPGF may be more effective for compensating past achievements and ensuring sustainability, while programs like the Grants Council focus on future-oriented projects and maintaining high standards of professionalism.Best practices include maintaining clarity and transparency throughout the grant process, avoiding rule changes mid-term, and ensuring fairness through multiple scorers and feedback steps. Establishing clear objectives and metrics for evaluation can enhance the quality of grants and outcomes.Effectiveness is evaluated through metrics assigned to each grant mission, ensuring that grantees meet specific criteria. This includes tracking the long-term impact and sustainability of projects, rather than just short-term growth. For educational grants, follow-up on the career progression of educated individuals is also important.Challenges in decentralization include ensuring fairness, transparency, and effective decision-making processes. There is a need for improved coordination and understanding among ecosystem participants to address issues such as misaligned incentives and ensuring that grants genuinely solve real-world problems.Learnings from BadgeholdersRetroPGF through Optimism is considered one of the best grant programs due to its low bureaucratic overhead and flexibility for grantees. Retro Quadratic Funding (QF) rounds also stand out for their ability to involve the community and simultaneously provide financial support and marketing exposure to projects that have already made significant contributions.RetroPGF is an interesting model because its post-completion funding model ensures that projects have already delivered value before receiving grants. This reduces the pressure to meet predefined milestones and offers projects more freedom to adapt to the fast-moving industry landscape. The Optimism program’s simplicity, large funding rounds, and low overhead make it highly efficient for both projects and the ecosystem.Learnings from Gitcoin Grants RoundsGrants in Web3 are funds provided without an expectation of return or equity stake. Their historical purpose is to support public goods, infrastructure, or research that can advance human progress. In the crypto space, grants are often funded through token generation events (TGEs) and are meant to drive ecosystem growth by funding various initiatives.The purpose of grants is to ignite growth within ecosystems by using incentives. They aim to foster innovation and development in the Web3 space, although many grants have become part of marketing strategies rather than solely focusing on growth.Gitcoin’s grants are funded by the Ethereum community and the wider Web3 community, rather than through Gitcoin’s own treasury. This is different from many crypto grant programs that use funds generated through TGEs.Gitcoin employs a novel funding mechanism called quadratic funding, which is designed to enhance capital efficiency and support digital public goods.Gitcoin has its own treasury that funds development but does not run grant programs at scale. The grants are primarily for digital public goods and open-source software.Gitcoin is developing systems for better capital efficiency and allocation, with the goal of influencing broader grant programs and ecosystems. There’s a trend towards grants that can be converted into equity, which could provide a return on investment for grantors and enhance sustainability.The future may include more automated incentive structures based on on-chain network metrics, reducing reliance on human decision-making. Projects like Gitcoin’s work with Optimism on direct-to-contract incentives are examples of this trend.Noted for its mature evaluation process and comprehensive review system. RPGF program is well-structured with multiple stages of evaluation and metrics review.Recognized for its strong ecosystem and effective use of its treasury. ENS manages its grant programs creatively, balancing impact and capital allocation.Praised for its diverse programs and innovative approaches, including convertible grants to equity. The Solana foundation has demonstrated significant growth and effectiveness in its grant strategies.Each program excels in different areas, making direct comparisons challenging. Optimism is noted for its evaluation maturity, ENS for its effective ecosystem management and creative grant use, and Silvana for its innovative approaches and recent growth. The best program depends on specific criteria and goals.Clearly define the desired outcomes and return on investment (ROI). It’s crucial to understand how funding will translate into impact.Strong eligibility criteria are essential for efficient allocation of funds. Protocol Guild’s success is attributed to its well-defined criteria.Know your builders and provide additional support beyond funding. Implement milestones and accountability measures to ensure progress and alignment with goals.Effectiveness is best measured by defining clear outcomes, ROI, and using appropriate metrics and accountability controls. Tools alone are not enough; understanding the underlying questions and processes is key.The potential of decentralized grant programs lies in creating reputation systems that can track and evaluate the effectiveness of both programs and grantees. Open systems and public ledgers offer opportunities for developing these systems.Building a comprehensive map of grant programs, their impact, and connections can improve the efficiency of the grant process. This includes understanding how programs and grantees interact and contribute to the ecosystem.Gitcoin’s approach when it comes to grant funding: the ecosystem has a vision and the grant program derives its mission from it. Next, there’s granular objectives derived from the mission followed by key results for each and followed by leading indicators.The Gitcoin leadership strongly believes in the evolutionary approach, no metric is good because it becomes redundant over time-people learn how to “hack it”. This is aligned with other thought leaders in the ecosystem such as Metrics Garden.Incorporating feedback from participants is invaluable. Gitcoins products have evolved significantly since their inception due to feedback. They put emphasis on streamlining the application process and introduced more robust support systems to assist grantees. As a result, there was an 80% grantee satisfaction rate in GG20, the highest they’ve seen in at least the past year.Gitcoin is pioneering allocation mechanisms with Allo and growing the EVM grant pie as more and more L2s are supported by GrantsStack(the permissionless platform to manage grant programs).Learnings from OctantOne big takeaway is people don’t often read and pay attention to details. This observation applies to communities and users across the board from grantees to donors. Unless there’s repeated, consistent emphasis on communication and strong emphasis on any detail worth nothing, people are likely to ignore key pieces of information. A learning here has been to make it easier for people to understand and double down on communicating often and across channels.Learnings from GivethGrants in Web3 are decentralized financial mechanisms aimed at stimulating ecosystem growth by supporting projects that contribute to public goods, open-source infrastructure, and innovation. Unlike traditional grants, they should emphasize decentralized decision-making and often align with token economies, enabling project sustainability through economic models, rather than direct funding alone and community/ecosystem alignmentGiveth challenges the traditional grant model, viewing grants as inefficient and unsustainable. Instead, Giveth will soon propose a more innovative approach by enabling projects to tokenize and create self-sustaining economic models, allowing for long-term growth and a better alignment of incentives. This approach shifts from one-time grants to fostering ecosystems where projects can generate value through bonding curves and tokenized economies.The future of Web3 grants is seen as pluralistic, with a mix of decentralized governance models and council-led decisions. While grants might not ever be fully on-chain, the importance of efficiency, decentralized governance, and community involvement is clear. Retroactive funding mechanisms like RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) are predicted to become more prominent, reducing the bureaucratic burden on startups and fostering entrepreneurial freedom.Tips for improving grant programs:Eligibility clarity: Clear eligibility criteria and streamlined processes reduce wasted time for applicants.Community involvement: Programs that incorporate community feedback, such as Quadratic Funding rounds, can foster broader project support.Multiple program types: A pluralistic approach to funding (e.g., growth grants, builder grants, mission proposals) can cater to various ecosystem needsGrowing the ETH Pie: Giveth diverse grant programs are running on multiple chains and ecosystemsEvaluating the net value of grant programs to the ecosystem is more relevant than individual project outcomes. A tolerance for failures, especially with small grants, and highlights the importance of viewing programs in aggregate. Decentralized impact measurement can help to avoid bureaucracy, especially for smaller grants, advocating for metrics that reflect broader ecosystem health.Decentralized governance in grant programs is seen as difficult to implement efficiently. While decentralized decision-making can bring greater community participation, the complexity of ensuring effective, scalable governance remains a significant challenge.The primary issue lies in the misalignment of incentives within traditional grant structures. Grantees may only meet the minimum requirements for receiving funds, creating inefficiencies. However, the ecosystem as a whole, particularly the reliance on grants without long-term sustainability models, is a bigger problem. By enabling projects to create their own token economies, the incentive structure can shift toward long-term value creation.2. Program EffectivenessEvaluating a grant program effectiveness should, in theory, be coupled with the alignment with the ecosystem it is funded by and program’s objectives should be derived from it.Ideally the ecosystem has an overarching strategy already available during the inception of a grant program, but it is also true that grant programs are growth tools that can also shape the ecosystem’s strategy itself. We could assume there is a a certain degree of interdependency here, but usually this becomes a reality only after a couple of iterations of grant programsWhile we recognize that every grant program is different(in approach and objective), some are highly experimental, some are mature, some are more transparent, some more opaque etc, we believe that the only way to evaluate a grant programs effectiveness, in the decentralized context of web 3, is in a way that enables covering the whole spectrum of possibilities. Our recommendation is to consider a mix of the following approaches:a) Diverse metrics, outcomes and KPIs (Quantitative and qualitative)A comprehensive evaluation of a grant program’s effectiveness requires incorporating a broad range of metrics, both quantitative and qualitative. Utilizing multiple KPIs and clearly defined outcomes ensures a more holistic assessment. It is also true that limiting the evaluation to a only one set of metrics can ignore other aspects of the program and can also introduce vulnerabilities, particularly for ongoing programs, as it may fail to capture the full scope of impact and long-term sustainability. Allowing the community to co-propose part of these metrics would be a solution towards a more optimal pool of metrics.b) Prioritizing key accomplishments to reduce signal-to-noise ratioBy isolating and emphasizing the most significant achievements of a grant program, stakeholders can better assess the program’s overall value. This approach allows for a clearer understanding of whether the program’s outcomes justify the allocated resources. A fundamental principle is that a grant program demonstrating multiple high-value successes may signal continued funding and support.c) Assessing program effectiveness relative to maturityAs a grant program matures, the complexity and depth of its evaluations should increase accordingly. More mature programs should have more complex metrics and also undergo more sophisticated reviews to accurately assess their long-term effectiveness and sustainability, accounting for their growth and evolving impact over time. The implications of Goodhart’s law need to be considered when attempting to define the leading metrics of evaluating a grant program’s effectiveness, especially if the program is not at its first iteration.d) Independent audits by neutral third partiesGiven the capital-intensive nature of grant programs, neutral third-party audits, alongside ecosystem evaluations, are crucial to determining whether funds are being deployed efficiently and equitably. These audits help ensure that the distribution of resources aligns with the goals of fostering growth and inclusivity across the potential applicant pool.For the purpose of this study we have considered three main areas that cover the spectrum of the quantifiable information about a grant program in a large proportion, while also enabling a more direct and neutral approach of assessing a grant program’s effectiveness. The three aspects we will explore are: Alignment with ecosystem goals and strategic impact, Ecosystem growth, community development and sustainable impact, Innovation and value creation. Each section will contain metrics and formulas for how to assess these areas in a grant program. Milestone achievements are not covered in this study, but they are prerequisites.The metrics and formulas explored in detail in the sections below should be seen as one relevant subset of the total number of possible relevant metrics that can measure program effectiveness, the main goal being to both equip and inspire grant program managers and ecosystems with a more advanced and neutral set of formulas that can be used to determine a grant program’s effectiveness.It is important to mention this is an exploratory approach that attempts to evolve the current metrics and formulas used in the present, not exact science. The formulas presented below can be applied per grant and averaged per total number of grantees or per program. All the possible scoring options are not explored in the section below, but some formats are suggested.1. Alignment with ecosystem goals and strategic impactThe goal of this section is to explore and attempt to determine, at least to a degree, how well the grant program aligns with broader strategic objectives and priorities within the ecosystem that funded it. Below we present and explore formulas and indicators that can be adapted on a case by case basis to help measure goal alignment and strategic impact.Strategic Alignment Score(SAS)Evaluating whether the funded projects align with the strategic goals of the ecosystem or community (e.g., driving adoption, improving infrastructure, ensuring scalability, security, decentralization, etc) is one of the most important aspects when analyzing grant program effectiveness. Projects should in theory directly contribute to achieving key milestones or overcoming critical challenges that the ecosystem faces.The Strategic Alignment Score (SAS) can help quantify how well projects align with the strategic goals of the ecosystem that funded them. The availability of clearly defined goals and project reporting is necessary for the calculation.Where:Agi = Alignment score of project i for strategic goal g (on a 1-5 scale), based on project reports, objectives milestones and external reviews.Wg = Weight of the strategic goal 𝑔 (on a 0-1 scale) based on its importance in the ecosystem.N= Number of projectsG= Total number of relevant strategic goals the grant program addresses (e.g., adoption, innovation, problem-solving, scalability, security, etc.)Min score =1, Max score =5Grant applications, project reports,forums, roadmaps and ecosystem documents could be used as data sources if the information is not available. Weightings can be derived through stakeholder feedback or predefined priorities.Ex: A grant program has funded 5 projects.The Ecosystem that funded it had the following goals: 1) Grow the ecosystem in a sustainable way 2) Fund projects that develop infrastructure.Goal 1 is more important than Goal 2.Number of Projects (N) = 5Number of Goals (G) = 2For each goal g, we’ll assume the alignment scores(in practice these scores need to be assigned by reviewers) for the 5 projects and the weights(G1>G2) for the two goals:Goal 1: Grow the ecosystem in a sustainable wayAlignment Scores (on a scale of 1-5):Project 1: A1,1=4Project 2: A1,2=5Project 3: A1,3=3Project 4: A1,4=4Project 5: A1,5=2Weight of Goal1: W1=0.7Goal 2: Fund projects that develop infrastructureAlignment Scores (on a scale of 1-5):Project 1: A2,1=3Project 2: A2,2=2Project 3: A2,3=4Project 4: A2,4=5Project 5: A2,5=3Weight of Goal 2: W2=0.3 (less important than Goal1)Calculation:1. Average Alignment score(Agi) for Goal 1:Ag,i =(4+5+3+4+2)/ 5= 3.6Average alignment score(Agi) for Goal 2:Ag,i =(3+2+4+5+3​)/5= 3.4Weighted score for Goal 1:(3.6×0.7)=2.52Weighted score for Goal 2:(3.4×0.3)=1.025. SAS for the Program:SAS=2.52+1.02=3.54Problem-solving capacity(PSC)Grant programs can encounter a diverse spectrum of “issues” such as: lack of coordination, KYC/KYB issues, extractive behaviors, suboptimal processes which are all experienced in a live environment. To thoroughly analyze effectiveness of a program the teams or managers problem solving capacity should be considered.The Problem-solving capacity (PSC) formula can help measure how well managing teams respond to issues. To keep it realistic, we focus on available data such as time to resolve issues and reported effectiveness.Where:I = Total number of issues encountered (e.g., system errors, project obstacles, technical challenges).Ti = Time taken to resolve issue i (measured in days)Ei = Effectiveness score for resolving issue i, typically rated on a scale (e.g., 1-5) based on the improvement or feedback after the issue is resolved.Cj = Complexity score of issue j (e.g., on a scale of 1-5).Incident reports, issue tracking systems (e.g., GitHub, JIRA, Notion, etc), and team performance reviews can be used as data sources.The resolution time is likely to be available or sampled via feedback forms for grantees. Effectiveness may need to be based on subjective feedback and qualitative reporting.Long-term vision and roadmap contribution score(LTRS)Examining how grant-funded projects contribute to the long-term vision and roadmap of the ecosystem is one of the most important areas to explore. This involves assessing the project’s vision, sustainability, potential for long-term impact, and ability to evolve with the ecosystem’s needs. Projects that align well with the ecosystem’s vision and can be more effective at solving critical problems, innovating, scaling or just adapting over time tend to be more valuable.The Long-Term vision and roadmap contribution score (LTRS) evaluates how well a project or program contributes to the ecosystem’s long-term goals, which requires assessing sustainability, scalability, and flexibility to evolve.Where:Vgi​ = Vision alignment score for project i on goal g (1-5 scale).Sgi​ = Scalability potential for project i on goal g (1-5 scale).E = Number of long-term ecosystem goals assessed in the grant program.I= Total number of issues or long-term goals across all projects, i.e., I=P×EP = Total number of projects in the grant program.Min score=1, Max score=5Collaboration Index (CI)Collaboration generally leads to innovation and should be seen as a sign of a healthy ecosystem. The Collaboration index (CI) measures the level of cooperation between different ecosystem participants (partnerships, joint ventures, etc.). It can be defined as:Where:Np= Number of active partnerships due to the grant programNj= Number of joint ventures due to the grant programNco = Number of cross-organization/chain/protocol collaborationsP= Total number of grant-funded projects in the programC=Total number of collaborations per projectMin score=1, Max score = , Any score over 1 is a sign of a healthy grant programA higher CI suggests a more interconnected and collaborative ecosystem.Developer Reputation Score (DRS)Web3 revolves around reputation although this aspect is usually not directly discussed in the context of web3 grant programs. The Developer Reputation Score (DRS) can evaluate developers history based on their contributions and influence within the ecosystem. This formula combines multiple factors like contributions, peer reviews, and community engagement:Where:Ci = Number of contributions by developer i (1-5 scale)Qi = Quality score of contributions, based on peer reviews, analytics or consensus (1-5 scale)Di = Developer’s influence (e.g., GitHub stars, forum followers, peer recognition on a 1-5 scale)N = Total number of developers being evaluated per program/projectMin score=1, Max score=5This score aggregates contribution volume and quality, giving weight to both output and influence. The most accessible and reliable data will likely come from open-source repositories (e.g., GitHub), developer forums, peer reviews, and other metrics such as stars, followers, and reputation on developer platforms. Projects such as Open Source Observer coupled with other tools can help us track developer activity and calculate the DRS.g) Ecosystem loyalty score(ELS):In web3 there is a phenomenon known as “grant hopping”- projects that have the tendency to apply in multiple grant programs from different ecosystems solely for the purpose of raising funding. The Loyalty score(ELS) has the goal of evaluating the degree of “loyalty” a project has within an ecosystem and can represent a solution to help solve this issue:Where:ELS = Ecosystem Loyalty Score (between 0 and 1).Pl = Number of projects that have received grants from only one ecosystem.Ph = Number of projects that have received grants from multiple ecosystems.Min score=0, Max score=1The closer the score is to 1, the higher the degree of loyaltySome non-botable metrics include:Community sentiment and trust score (CSTS)The Community sentiment and trust score (CSTS) attempts to quantify the overall trust and sentiment of the community towards the grant-funded projects. Data can be collected from sentiment analysis tools on community forums, social media, and governance platforms to gauge community trust and sentiment towards grant-funded projects.Several platforms can be considered as data sources: X, Discourse, Tally, Karma, etc. This metric is harder to manipulate because it involves parsing through large amounts of diverse, user-generated content.Where:Si​ = Sentiment score of post i (e.g., from sentiment analysis tools, ranging from -1 for negative to +1 for positive)Ti = Trust score of post i based on user engagement (e.g., upvotes, likes, or similar metrics)N = Total number of analyzed posts or user-generated content per project/programMin score=-1, Max score=1This formula uses a weighted average of community posts and engagementto gauge overall sentiment.b) Grant Impact Score (GIS)To assess the effectiveness and impact of a grant-funded project, we can calculate a Grant Impact Score (GIS) that incorporates innovation, collaboration, developer reputation, and community sentiment:GIS=(CI× w1) + (DRS × w2) + (CSTS × w3) + (II × w4) + (ELS× w5) + (LTRS × w6) + (Li × w7) + (SAS × w8) + ….Where:SAS, CI, DRS, and CST, ELS are as defined aboveI= Innovation Index described in the Innovation and value creation sectionw[1…n]​ = Weighting factors based on the relative importance of collaboration, developer reputation, and community trust for the grant program. Program managers and relevant stakeholders would define them.Multiple metrics can be added here and interpretation is based on the weight factorsThe scale is optional, it can be normalized to a scale of 0 to 5 or a different one.This composite score gives an overall view of the project’s impact and effectiveness, balancing collaboration, developer reputation, and community trust.Ecosystem growth. community development and sustainable impactDefining and measuring how the grant program contributes to the long-term growth and sustainability of the Web3 ecosystem should be one of the priorities in grant programs.The list below captures broad formulas that can be considered to evaluate a grant program’s effectiveness in terms of ecosystem growth. It is important to mention that each of the formulas can and should be adapted to the scope and timeline of the grant program analyzed. Users is a broad term and can refer to: dapp/protocol users, lenders/borrowers, contributors, marketers, developers, community members, artists, people onboarded, etcUser activity and engagement depth(UAED)Grants are growth tools, growth involves increased user activity. This metric broadly helps us calculate the average number of meaningful interactions* (e.g., transactions, votes, contributions, etc) per daily active user.Where:DAU = The total number of daily users, which would be the sum of all users across group gMIU= Meaningful interactions per user( as defined depending by the grant program)G = The total number of groups or clusters of users. Each group has similar activity patterns or engagement levels.Wᵍ = The weight assigned to interactions by users in group g (if needed, to represent the importance of the group’s engagement).Ng= The number of users in group g.Min score=0, Max score = NCommunity sentiment score(CSS)This is a holistic metric, it can be complex to quantify and collect the data required, the assumption being there are stakeholders that can help define it such as: delegates, grantees, ecosystem contributors, etc. Surveys, polls, etc may help further clarify as well. Community forums and social media platforms could also be considered as data sources.WherePs= Positive sentimentNs= Negative sentimentT = Total mentions - the total number of opinions collected from multiple sources: contributors, surveys, forums, comments, etcEcosystem integration index(EII)This describes the possible integrations achieved by grant-funded projects with other ecosystem projects.Total number of integrations with other projects, protocols, initiatives, etc that were achieved during or after the grant programWhereIi =: Number of integrations achieved by project iii with other ecosystem projects, protocols, initiatives, etc. (an integer).Wi=​ Weight or significance of the integrations achieved by project iii (a score from 1 to 5, representing the impact or relevance of the integration).P = Total number of grant-funded projects in the ecosystem that are being assessed.T = Total number of possible integrations (this could be a benchmark or an estimated number of integrations expected within the ecosystem).If this metric is <1, it is a sign of a healthy grant program, normalization is difficult due to the fact that T is not standard​Retention and churn analysis(RCA)Measures how many users remain active over time using cohort analysis. Can be applied per project or per grant program.RCA =(Cohort of users before the program /​Cobort of users after the program) x 100Tools such as Dune and other user data tracking tools can be used for data collection.Developer contribution quality index(DCQI)Measures the quality of code contributions on Github using code reviews, bug reports, and test coverage per project.The DCQI should be computed before and after the grant program and compared.DCQI = ((PCR −BR)/TC)​×100Where:PCR - Positive Code Reviews = The number of code reviews with positive feedback per program/projectBR - Bug Reports = The number of bug reports generated from the contributions per program/projectTC = The total number of contributions made by developers (e.g., commits, pull requests) per program/project.Community engagement rate(CER)Percentage of new users actively participating in community governance and forums. The CER should be computed before and after the grant program and the results should be compared.CER =(ACP/TU​)×100Where:ACP - Active Community Participants = The number of active community participants that are involved in governance, forums, etc after the grant program.TU = The total number of usersTally, Karma, Snapshot, Forum APIs are the required data sources.Ecosystem diversity index(EDI)Ratio of unique project categories funded compared to total existing categories, indicating diversity. Categories can be new verticals, or new domains within a vertical, for example for the DEFI vertical we can have multiple domains: social-fi, meme-fi, etc. REFI would be considered a new vertical.EDI =UPCF/TCPWhere:TCP - Total Project Categories = The total number of project categories that exist or are recognized within the ecosystem prior to the grant program.UPCF - Unique Project Categories Funded = The number of distinct project categories that have received funding. This includes all unique categories that projects fall into within the grant program.A ratio closer to 0 would indicate that not a lot of new domains or vertical are brought by the grant program.Target user(developer, client, builder, etc) onboarding rate(TUOR)Percentage of new target users entering the ecosystem through grant-funded projects. Target users can are defined by the grant programs goal, they could be: developers/builders, users, marketers, artists, degens, regens, etcTUOR =(NU/T)×100Where:NU - New Target Users in Ecosystem = The number of new users (developers, builders, users, marketers, artists, etc.) that have joined the ecosystem through grant-funded projects.T -Total Target Users Pre-Grant =The number of target users in the ecosystem before the grant program started.Min score = 0% (if no new target users have entered the ecosystem).Max score = 100% or higher (depending on how many new users joined compared to the initial user base).3. Innovation and value creationThe objective of this section is to assess the extent to which Web3 grant programs stimulate innovation, innovative solutions and generate tangible value within the ecosystem. Key indicators such as innovation, economic impact, and cross-protocol synergies will be evaluated. As in the sections above, the indicators and formulas below can be derived and adapted to a specific grant programs mission, timelines and context:a) Innovation Index (II)To measure innovation, we will focus on available data such as technological breakthroughs (based on publications or major releases), patents filed and the introduction of novel protocols or use cases within the ecosystem.Where:Pi = Number of innovations, technological breakthroughs, patents or intellectual property filings by the grantees i, normalized on a scale (e.g., 0-1 if binary data or scale of 1-5 if more qualitative).Ti​ = Technological breakthroughs achieved by project i, based on peer reviews, expert assessments, protocol releases, new dapps, usescases, etc (on a scale of 1-5).N = Total number of projects evaluated for innovation.Min score=1, Max score=5b) Economic Impact (EI)Economic impact is a complex metric to analyze as it involves multiple sub-metrics. It’s easier to attempt to quantify based on revenue, user growth, transaction volume, and liquidity as this data is usually available from multiple sources( project reporting, blockchain analytics platforms, and market cap aggregators). The formula below should be considered a multi dimensional approach to quantifying economic impact.EI =(ΔR+ΔU+ΔTV+ΔL+ΔM)/Ti × Fₜ × 5Where:ΔR = Percentage change in revenue or economic value created by the project.ΔU = User growth rate over time (e.g., percentage increase in users).ΔTV = Change in transaction volume contributed by the granteess (in terms of on-chain activity).ΔL = Change in liquidity added to the ecosystem by the granteesΔM = Market capitalization growth of the project or related tokens.Fₜ adds weight to projects that show sustained growth over time. Fₜ = 1 for projects with short-term impact and Fₜ > 1 for those that maintain or grow over longer periods. This rewards projects that contribute long-term stability rather than just short-term spikes.Ti= Total number of submetrics usedMin score=0, Max score=5Revenue and user growth can be found in project reports, user analytics tools, or tokenomics data. Transaction volume and liquidity data can be retrieved from blockchain explorers, DeFi platforms, or public blockchain metrics. Market cap data is available from aggregators such as CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.d) Important successes/Total projects ratio (ISR)This metric measures the effectiveness of a grant program by analyzing the ratio of high-success projects to total funded projects. “Success” is based on objective (e.g., revenue generation, user growth) and subjective (e.g., community impact, innovation) measures.ISR =S/TWhere:S = Number of “high-success” projects, based on both objective (e.g., revenue, users, technical advancements, partnerships, etc) and subjective criteria (e.g., expert assessment, community feedback).T = Total number of grant-funded projects.A common rule of thumb is that if at least 5-10% of the grantees are considered high successes, the program is deemed effective.Min score=0, Max score=1Success criteria can be derived from project performance reports, revenue data, user metrics, or subjective assessments from community feedback or expert panels. Total number of projects is easily available from the grant program’s records.e) Comprehensive ecosystem innovation score (CECS)To evaluate a project’s overall contribution to innovation, we can combine the previous metrics into a weighted score based on the importance of innovation, economic impact, network effects, and success ratio.CECS = (II×w1)+(EI×w2)+(NEXS×w3)+(ISR×w4)Where:II, EI, NEXS, and ISR are the previously defined metrics.w1​, w2​, w3​, and w4 are weighting factors that reflect the relative importance of each metric in evaluating a project’s success and contribution to the ecosystem.The scale is optional, it can be normalized to a scale or 0 to 5 or a different one.Each component can use data from public project reports, blockchain analytics, collaboration records, and ecosystem engagement. Weightings can be adjusted depending on the priorities of the grant program or the ecosystem.Innovation is a key driver of growth and evolution in the Web3 ecosystem. Grant programs that successfully fund innovative projects can ensure continuous advancement, addressing both emerging challenges and opportunities. By evaluating the effectiveness of these programs in fostering innovation and economic growth, the study aims to provide a comprehensive view of their long-term value.Examples of interpretations for the metrics above:A project with a high Innovation Index(II) but a low Economic Index(EI) could indicate that the project is potentially groundbreaking but has yet to achieve commercial success or adoption. This could be a sign of high potential if properly nurtured.If a grant program has a high ISR, this indicates that it is funding projects with notable successes, justifying continued investment into the grant pool. Conversely, a low ISR suggests many funded projects are failing to achieve their intended outcomes.For most grant programs, gathering comprehensive data into a single source of truth may present challenges. Adaptations to data collection methods and formulas should be made based on the maturity and scope of the grant program.The aspect of maturity in grant programsWhen analyzing program effectiveness it is best to consider how “mature” a grant program is before attempting to derive proper KPIs/ metrics/formulas. We recommend increasing the complexity of the metrics used directly proportional to the maturity level.Generally, they can be categorized into three maturity stages, and it is important to consider these stages when deriving metrics:Pilot Programs or early experimentsExamples: ThankARB, Polygon’s Quadratic Accelerator, and StarkNet’s Seed Grant Program. These are in their first or second iterations.Programs Reaching a Certain Level of MaturityExamples: ENS and Octant, which are in their third or fourth iterations.Mature Programs:Examples: Aave Grants DAO, Optimism’s- RPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding), and Gitcoin Rounds(GG1-GG21), which have undergone five or more iterations.3. Maturity Framework:Link to Maturity FrameworkCategories for IndicatorsProgram stability and growth: Indicators that measure the longevity, expansion, and adaptability of the program.Governance and decision-making: Indicators that assess the structure, transparency, and inclusivity of decision-making processes.Support for grantees: Indicators that reflect the various types of support provided to grantees, both financial and non-financial.Operational efficiency and sophistication: Indicators that evaluate the effectiveness and sophistication of the program’s processes and operations.Community and impact: Indicators that measure the program’s engagement with the community and its broader impact on the ecosystem.The indicators in each category have different weightage, with our recommended indicator weight in the Refined Formula subsheet. We’ve defined each indicator with a score ranging from 1 to 4 where applicable. To calculate your program’s maturity score, multiply the indicator weight with the indicatore score on the right and add the sum.As a scoring design principle, we don’t recommend changing the weights, but in the case that you feel it’s inapplicable to you and you change the indicator weights, make sure you have weights of differing scores. Some indicators (those with higher weights like 2 or 3) should have a more significant impact on the overall score, so reflect this in the calculations.Indicator Scoring LogicBasic/Entry Level: Indicates minimal maturity where the program is either new, inexperienced, or lacks robust systems.Developing: Represents moderate maturity with some operational processes and governance in place, but with room for growth.Mature: Demonstrates a mature program, where systems, decision-making, and outputs are well-developed and effective.Highly Sophisticated: Reflects a fully optimized and sophisticated program that excels in multiple dimensions, often leading the industry.How to Use This Framework in ScoringAssess each program indicator: For each indicator (e.g., Time frame, Grantees, Demand for program, etc.), assign a score (1 to 4) based on the program’s current state.Multiply each score by its weight: For example, for “Demand for program,” if the score is 3 (because the program has 200 applicants) and the weight is 2, the weighted score is 3×2=63 \times 2 = 63×2=6.Sum the weighted scores: Once you’ve assigned scores to all indicators, multiply each by its respective weight, then sum them to get the total maturity score.Example CalculationLet’s say a program has the following characteristics:Time frame: 3+ years → Score = 3 (Weight = 1) → Weighted score = 3×1=33 \times 1 = 33×1=3Grantees: 150+ → Score = 3 (Weight = 1) → Weighted score = 3×1=33 \times 1 = 33×1=3Demand for program: 200 applicants → Score = 3 (Weight = 2) → Weighted score = 3×2=63 \times 2 = 63×2=6Program Review/Audit: Community feedback → Score = 3 (Weight = 2) → Weighted score = 3×2=63 \times 2 = 63×2=6Non-financial support: Mentorship and guidance → Score = 3 (Weight = 2) → Weighted score = 3×2=63 \times 2 = 63×2=6Total score for these indicators: 3+3+6+6+6=243 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 243+3+6+6+6=24IndicatorsIndicatorDefinitionTime frame each program has been in existenceTime frame each program has been in existence: Measures the duration of the grant program’s operation, reflecting its stability and ability to evolve over time.Team maturityRefers to the experience, expertise, and stability of the team managing the grant program. This accounts for the fact that growing programs and application intakes will require bigger teams who take responsibility for comms, marketing, and community efforts, grantee support, application processes, and events.Mode and process of decision-makingIndicates the decision-making processes used by the grant program, focusing on inclusivity, transparency, and community involvement.Grant SizesReflects the range and scale of the financial grants offered by the program, indicating its capacity to support various project scopes.Process sophistication (how are GOs tracking grantees)Measures the sophistication of the processes used by the grant operator (GO) to track and monitor grantees’ progress.Program Review /AuditAssesses the extent and quality of reviews and audits conducted on the grant program to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.Speed of changes and implementationMeasures how quickly the grant program can adapt to changes and implement new processes or improvements.GranteesEvaluates the number of grantees and grant applications supported by the program, reflecting its reach and impact.Success storiesAssesses the long-term success of grantees, particularly in their ability to become financially sustainable and contribute to the ecosystem. The ultimate marker of a success story being a grantee project that has grown to develop their own grants programNon-financial systems of support for grantees.The availability and quality of non-financial support systems provided to grantees, such as mentorship, marketing, and technical assistance.The stage of operationsReflects the complexity and variety of the grant program’s operations, including the diversity of tracks and categories.Resources needed to run the programAssesses the resources required to effectively run the grant program, including human resources, advisory councils, and other support structures.Accessibility and playbooks for programsThe availability and quality of playbooks, best practices, and resources provided to applicants and grantees.Output and outcome measurementThe extent and sophistication of measuring the outputs and outcomes of the grant program effectively.Transparency, Learnings and ReportingThe transparency of the grant program’s processes, the effectiveness of sharing learnings, and the thoroughness of reporting practices.Program DesignThe structure and inclusiveness of the program design, including the involvement of different stakeholders in the design process.Demand for program (Applicants)Measures the level of interest and demand for the grant program, indicated by the number of applications received.CommunityAssesses the extent of community involvement and support in the grant program, including how the program engages and integrates community feedback.Maturity Score ResultsMaturity Score RangeMaturity LevelProgram CharacteristicsRecommendations0 - 20Emerging (Level 1)* Program is in its early stages.Limited or no systems in place.Minimal support for grantees.No transparency or basic reporting.|* Focus on building basic systems for program management and support.Consider defining roles within the team and adding a structured decision-making process.Start collecting data for basic reporting and transparency.Expand grantee support with non-financial assistance (e.g., marketing, mentorship).||21 - 40|Developing (Level 2)|* Program is maturing but still has room for growth.Some structures in place for governance, decision-making, and grantee support.Basic processes for review and audits exist.Limited non-financial support for grantees.|* Strengthen decision-making processes by incorporating more feedback loops (team + community).Increase transparency in program reporting and decision-making.Improve non-financial support for grantees, such as by offering mentorship or community support.Streamline resource management and program scalability.||41 - 60|Mature (Level 3)|* Well-established program with strong governance and decision-making systems.Programs have a history of sustained operations.Grantees are supported both financially and non-financially.Moderate to high transparency in program operations.|* Focus on refining the decision-making process by including external, neutral audits or feedback from the community.Enhance grantee support systems by formalizing mentorship programs or establishing accelerator-like structures.Measure outcomes more comprehensively to assess the true impact of the program.Leverage the maturity to expand the program (e.g., create more tracks or categories for funding).||61 - 80|Sophisticated (Level 4)|* Highly sophisticated program with robust processes in place for all areas (governance, support, transparency).Programs operate across multiple tracks or categories.Strong financial and non-financial support for grantees, including access to accelerators, mentorship, and comprehensive systems.Highly transparent with detailed reporting and outcome measurement.|* Continue to innovate by implementing cutting-edge technologies or methodologies to improve operational efficiency.Build global partnerships and networks to increase program reach and impact.Continue to iterate and improve based on grantee and community feedback loops.Push for stronger scalability while maintaining quality.||81 - 100|Leader/Exemplar (Level 5)|* Leading-edge program that sets standards in governance, transparency, and support.Programs highly transparent and fully accountable.Provides extensive support, helping grantees grow into funders themselves or start grant programs.Operates in a highly decentralized, community-driven model.|* Use your status as a leader to guide and mentor other programs.Share best practices with other organizations looking to improve their grant programs.Focus on maintaining quality while pushing boundaries in terms of innovation and program expansion.Continuously assess and adapt to the changing needs of grantees and the broader community.|Measuring Over TimeThe score can be used as a way to compare and analyze performance over time. We recommend keeping the same indicator weights when comparing a program over a period of time.When using the framework, create a separate table analyzing the scores with a reasoning behind what went well and what didn’t go well. After scoring, this subsheet can be used to retrospect on the program and used to create an action plan for improving the program.We caution against a “vanity” score which results in bias to score high despite a lower-level indicator score in actuality. To reduce bias, we recommend the scoring with the same indicator weights to be done by a few different stakeholders in the program including trusted grantees, operators, core team, and the community. Compare the scores and average the score, with analysis of the reasoning behind scoring.To improve the indicator scores, we recommend creating an action plan that tackles the root cause of the lower score. An honest and brutal assessment will allow for a more effective review and improvement plan eventually.4. Impact MetricsTackling impact and understanding and finalizing the right impact metrics is one of the toughest tasks a grant operator can undertake. No one has cracked the answer to this, but in this study we’ve attempted to tackle this in a holistic way. Solely relying on quantitative or qualitative data is going to lead to one-dimensional reporting and will be a very limited view on the impact of the program and on end-user beneficiaries (i.e. people and projects benefiting from the grantee’s work). A challenge with quantitative metrics is the ability to game metrics through measures that include sybil, bots, and fraud. A project that is aiming to tackle this is Impact Garden by Metrics Garden (Impact Garden’s mission is standardized data generation specifically for qualitative data.)A challenge with qualitative data is lack of reliability and lack of standards in collecting, reporting, and verifying this data.There is a further issue with vanity metrics, i.e. metrics that don’t serve any purpose other than to paint the program in a positive light, to give the illusion of progress or impact. This can be severely harmful to a program’s growth.With that said, below we’ve listed a comprehensive list of metrics in different categories and areas that can be useful to grant programs.We’d like to point out the need for a standard for metrics that can be used at large by all programs, that would allow for the best comparisons.Another important consideration is that grant programs can also have extremely positive sum side-effects (accomplishments) that are directly/indirectly created by the grant program which cannot be accurately quantified solely by impact metrics.Layer-2s /Blockchain MetricsMetricDefinitionTVLTotal Value LockedWalletsWallets created through grantee on the L2UsersDaily Active Users (DAU)Weekly Active UsersMonthly Active UsersDaily New UsersWeekly New UsersMonthly New UsersMeaningful Active Users(MAU)User activity and engagement depth(UAED)Retention and churn analysis(RCA)Target user onboarding rate(TUOR)TransactionsNumber of transactions that takes place on the L2Weekly TransactionsMonthly TransactionsRevenueDaily Network Revenue ($USD)Monthly Network Revenue ($USD)Weekly Network Profit ($USD)Monthly Network Profit ($USD)Profit: L2 Transaction FeesCommunityMetricDefinitionCommunity SizeNumber of people in the communityActive Community MembersActive community members as defined by the grant programs objectiveCommunity RetentionDefined in alignment with the grant program objectivesNet Community ScoreNumber of people who feel connected being part of the communityCommunity Sentiment and Trust Score(CSTS)The overall trust and sentiment of the community towards grant-funded projects.Community Sentiment Score(CSS)Attempts to quantify the community’s perception on certain initiativesCommunity Engagement Rate(CER)Percentage of new users actively participating in community governance and forums.MarketingMetricSpecificsFollowersNumber of followers over a period of time on a platformImpressionsNumber of views on a piece of postSubscribersNumber of subscribers to a newsletterCTR (Click-through Rate)The percentage of clicks on a piece of contentEngagementLikes, Replies, Comments, bookmarks,Time SpentDuration spent engaging with contentConversion rateTotal number of sign-ups or interactions to the program versus the total reachCommunity EngagementNumber of community members that post about the programEventsMetricDefinitionSignupsNumber of signups to the eventConfirmed AttendeesConfirmed number of attendees to an eventPOAPsNumber of POAPs minted during an eventNeutral AttendeesNumber of people that are not in the same social graph with the organizersOnchain activitySpikes in on chain activity directly linked to the eventGrant ProgramMetricDefinitionTotal Grant Applications ReceivedTotal number of grant applications received by the programTotal Applications ApprovedTotal number of grants given out by the programCompleted ProjectsGrantees who successfully completed the project they received a grant forSustainable ProjectsGrantees who have been able to achieve financial and project sustainability after receiving a grantInnovation Index(II)Attempts to measure innovation focusing on official and unofficial technological breaktroughts of a certain grantImportant successes/Total projects ration (ISR)This metric measures the effectiveness of a grant program by analyzing the ratio of high-success projects to total funded projects.Ecosystem diversity index(EDI)Ratio of unique project categories funded compared to total existing categories, indicating diversity.Collaboration Index(CI)Collaboration generally leads to innovation and should be seen as a sign of a healthy ecosystemQualitative MetricsMetricDefinitionGrant Impact Score(GIS)Attempts to incorporate innovation, collaboration, developer reputation, and community sentiment and other metrics into a single score.Developer Reputation Score(DRS)Evaluates developers history based on their contributions and influence within the ecosystem.Most Significant Change (MSC) as a result of the project10-step process for for ongoing monitoring and for evaluation purposesTeam reputationPublic speaking and community engagements, press features and mentions, public-facing writing, and social media mentions by people of notability.Long-term vision and roadmap contribution score(LTRS)Evaluates how well a project or program contributes to the ecosystem’s long-term goals, which requires assessing sustainability, scalability, and flexibility to evolve.Effect on end-users web3 trajectoryThis measures the effect of the grant in the form of onboarding new users into the industry and ecosystem.Strategic Alignment Score(SAS)Quantifies how well projects align with the strategic goals of the ecosystem that funded them.Ecosystem Loyalty Score(ELS)Evaluates the degree of “loyalty” a project has within an ecosystem that funded it.5. Integration, Refinement & ImplementationOur proposition for integration with RFP1 is to solve for reputation and ranking from a grantee and grants program perspective. For example, tiered ranking where grantees who’ve received grants are given categorized questions, to give feedback on different components of the grants program.The feedback and answers can be used to score the program on a scale, and can be comparatively used keeping the Maturity Framework in mind.An example of this would be to have a survey with questions around resources given to grantees for e.g. marketing and amplification support, partnership support, and questions assessing the level of support. Conversely grant program managers can attempt to assess certain qualities of their grantees via surveys, proof of work or other feedback gathering mechanisms.This could comparatively be used for ranking grant programs across industries, on one index.Note: This section is not final as we are researching multiple implementation options.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the following interviewees who’ve been graciously generous with their time and contributions to enhance the study.

It’s based on historical data which may not predict future market trends. Cryptocurrency markets are volatile and risky, and the authors bear no responsibility for any decisions made from this analysisTLDR: 5-point SummaryARB liquidity on CEX has plummeted, with even $2 million causing potential price impact of 20%ARB onchain liquidity is greatly improved in the aggregate and even better than CEX, primarily due to cross chain liquidity solutions. At the same time, ARB liquidity in individual DEX’s is highly variable depending on the dayThe highest volumes of ARB was traded at approximately $1.9.At $0.6 per ARB, 89% of ARB addresses are at a loss. At $1.35, around 50% of addresses are breakeven or in profit, serving as a sentiment turnaround point.Although price has reduced since September 2023, the market cap has grown suggesting a resilient and positive outlook for ARB in the long termLiquidity AnalysisCEX Liquidity AnalysisFig1:Orderbook Depth1910×750 30 KBRecent analyses indicate a significant decline in CEX order book depth, decreasing by approximately 50–80% from earlier estimates.As of September 25, 2024, a liquidation of merely $2 million on centralized exchanges (CEXs) can now result in a price impact exceeding 20% as seen in Fig1. In contrast our earlier analysis found the same amount led to only 2% slippage.Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability - Working GroupOrder-book depth: Current bid levels suggest that selling $1.5-2 million worth of the ARB which accounts for 15-20% of cumulative open bids is likely to keep slippage within a limit of 2%.When ARB was close to its peak price, the liquidity had surged to $13.5 million as mentioned in @karpatkey reportArbitrum Treasury and Sustainability ResearchThe current market can absorb approximately $13.5 million in ARB sales daily with a 2% price impact, considering the combined liquidity from both on-chain and off-chain trusted sources.While order books on CEXs limit price impact to 2% at a depth of $1 million, liquidity sharply declines once orders exceed the $1.5 million threshold. This decline suggests that Arbitrum markets are currently facing significant challenges across centralized exchanges.On-Chain Liquidity AnalysisFig2:Paraswap709×781 72.1 KBConversely, liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has shown significant improvement and has surpassed that of centralized exchanges. This enhancement is attributed to multiple initiatives undertaken by Arbitrum to bolster decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity and the implementation of cross-chain liquidity solutions.DEX aggregators are capable of providing up to 3.2 times the liquidity of CEXs as illustrated in Fig2. For larger order sizes ranging from $10 million to $20 million, DEXs demonstrate even greater capability, maintaining a price impact of approximately -20% for a $16 million liquidation. Notably, there is no significant liquidity cliff; the price impact increases by about 10% per $10 million increment up to $90 million, where the price impact plateaus at 90% with further impact being incremental.Fig3:Uniswap Depth900×970 99.3 KBHowever, individual DEXs outside the aggregate ecosystem still exhibit poor liquidity as seen in Fig3. Even a $50,000 buy order on Uniswap can move the price by 2%, indicating that the lack of cross-chain liquidity remains a pervasive issue affecting the entire DEX ecosystem.Fig4:Uniswap Variance749×850 21.3 KBSimilar to @Aera finding we discover that there is significant variability in the liquidity. On some days the depth on Uniswap can reach $300k and still stay within a 2% price impact as shown in Fig4.Arbitrum Treasury Management Report by AeraIn September 2023, a swap as small as 113k ARB could have moved the price down by more than 2%, whereas a month later, you could have sold 1M ARB and not moved the market nearly as much. Not only do liquidity conditions vary month to month, but they vary day to day. If ARB recipients are unaware that these differences can exist, they could very easily sell when the liquidity conditions are poor and not only achieve a worse outcome for themselves, but also for other ARB holders.Stakeholder AnalysisFig5: Volume & Price940×553 65.3 KBThe majority of  ARB volume traded was at approximately $1.90, indicating that a substantial portion have a relatively high entry price. The one-year Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of approximately $1.425 suggests that most ARB has been bought at a price 50% higher than current market levels.Fig6: Address-Profitability2298×554 80.7 KBAt price levels under $0.60, approximately 89% of ARB addresses are out of the money. While the price decrease is primarily driven by token unlocks, there is a need to attract capital inflows at current price levels.As seen in Fig6 price levels above $1.35—where over 50% of addresses are at or in the money —could serve as a turning point in price sentiment for the ecosystem at large. At these levels, the majority of those who are out of the money face losses within 30%, as opposed to the 60–70% decline at current price levels.Net Growth in Market CapitalizationFig7: Market Capitalization912×526 62.8 KBLast Years Market Cap (September 25, 2023): $1,029,069,885.73Current Market Cap (September 22, 2024): $2,172,337,433.11Overall Growth: The market capitalization has increased by approximately 111.10% over the observed period.Analysis of Net Market Cap Growth Despite Volatility and Severe Price CorrectionsEarly Stability (Late 2023):The period begins with a relatively low market capitalization of around $1 billion.Steady and gradual growth is observed during this time.Strong Bullish Momentum (Early 2024):A clear uptrend forms in early 2024 with significant growth in market capitalization.By late February and early March, the market cap surpasses the $3 billion mark during the recent bull run.Extreme Volatility (March 2024):A sharp spike occurs around March 2024 drive by unlocks, with the market cap surging to over $4.5 billion.This rise is followed by a dramatic correction, dropping to approximately $2.74 billion in April. Despite the correction, the market cap remains higher than initial levels in late 2023, indicating net growth even after the downturn.Continued Volatility with Growth (Mid-2024):Post-March correction, the market experiences another volatile phase, fluctuating between $2 billion and $3 billion, reaching a low of $1.61 billion in early August.High volatility is attributed to broader market corrections, external pressures, and liquidity issues driven by token unlocks. Nevertheless, the market cap holds above previous levels, maintaining a higher net value than the prior year.Stabilization and Resurgence (Late 2024):By September 2024, the market cap recovers from summer lows, staying above $2 billion.Although it does not return to early 2024 highs, the market cap shows net growth compared to September 2023 levels, indicating a positive long-term upward trend.Overall when we compare ARB’s liquidity to its marketcap, we agree with the conclusion of @chaoslabsTreasury Backed Vaults Risk AnalysisARB’s on-chain liquidity is relatively low when compared to its market capitalization.To conclude, the Arbitrum ecosystem is currently grappling with significant liquidity challenges on centralized exchanges, while decentralized platforms show promising improvements due to strategic initiatives although there is wide variability in liquidity across different days. Stakeholder sentiment has declined due to a majority being out of the money, highlighting the need for price stabilization strategies. Despite market volatility and severe price corrections, the asset has demonstrated net growth in market capitalization over the observed period, suggesting a resilient and positive long-term outlook.This report was funded through a ThankARB Firestarter Grant (powered by ThriveProtocol) to the Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability working group.

Market conditions are subject to change, and readers should conduct their own research and consult with professional advisors before making financial decisions. Any actions taken based on this article are at the reader’s own risk, and the authors bear no responsibility for the outcomes.IntroductionThis post aims to delve deeply into the mechanics and strategic advantages of implementing CDPs, specifically tailored to our Arbitrum DAO ecosystem growth programs, using our ARB token as the primary collateral. Our discussion will culminate in a dual call-to-action: integrating with a diverse range of DeFi lending platforms to Arbitrum and exploring the creation of an Arbitrum DAO-owned and managed CDP specifically for ecosystem growth.A Novel Approach to CDP Management using DAO-Owned LiquidationsARB CDP Flow1068×474 16 KBIn contrast to traditional CDP models, where positions are liquidated when collateral falls below a threshold, our approach introduces a DAO-owned liquidation mechanism. This mechanism ensures that additional collateral is injected to maintain a sufficiently collateralized state during market downturns, thereby providing a buffer against volatility. Conversely, when the price of the native token appreciates significantly, the DAO strategically liquidates the ARB collateral, using an optimized execution strategy to moderate market impact.1. DAO Deposits Collateral:The DAO starts by depositing ARB as collateral for funding positions.In parallel, the DAO also deposits/holds stable assets (e.g., RWA stablecoins) to ensure absolute solvency in worst-case scenarios.2. Stablecoin Issuance:A stablecoin is issued against the deposited ARB collateral. LTV ranges from ~50%-70% in the current market. The stablecoins are then offered to grantees in lieu of ARB, which is the current convention.3. Response to Price Increases:If the price of ARB increases, it triggers strategic liquidations.Following this, the DAO sells the ARB collateral and buys back stablecoins, squaring off the CDP partially or in whole.4. Response to Price Decreases:If the price of ARB decreases, an anti-liquidation bot gets triggered.Consequently, the DAO deposits ARB as additional collateral to stabilize the position to keep the CDP solvent.The above approach ensures that the system remains solvent and can handle significant price fluctuations in the collateral asset. The dual approach to dealing with price volatility—liquidation during price increases and additional collateral during price decreases—helps maintain the stability of the issued stablecoin and the collateral.Our proposal envisages the implementation of CDPs in a manner where grantees can receive funding through diverse instruments - direct grants, term loans, convertible notes, SAFTs, or SAFE agreements. This flexibility allows for a tailored approach to funding, accommodating the diverse needs of our ecosystem growth programs.Advantages of this ModelRisk Mitigation: By actively managing collateral levels at the DAO scale, we can significantly reduce the systemic risk associated with market volatility.Flexibility and Autonomy: This approach provides the DAO with greater control over its financial operations, enabling more strategic capital management. The DAO gains significant flexibility in timing grants and liquidations. We can issue grants without the immediate need to liquidate assets, allowing us to choose the most opportune moments for market action. This flexibility also means we can proactively take positions, aligning with our spending plans for ecosystem growth and potentially improving financial outcomes.Market Stabilization: A significant advantage of this approach is the ability to have DAO-owned liquidations. This means that Arbitrum DAO can directly control the liquidation process of ARB or other assets used as collateral. By doing so, we can strategically liquidate assets in a way that minimizes market impact and aligns with our broader market strategies. This approach contrasts sharply with relying on third-party liquidators, who may prioritize their interests over those of our DAO.Case Study: Effective Market Stabilization by Arbitrum DAOExecutive SummaryThis case study delves into how the Arbitrum DAO effectively stabilizes the ARB market, particularly focusing on its strategic interventions, assuming a lower limit and higher limit range to be the optimal bracket for the purpose of this study. Utilizing a combination of market absorption capacity, mean trading volume, and DAO interventions, this analysis showcases the innovative approach to managing both bearish and bullish market scenarios.Market Context and ARB’s PositionVolatility and Liquidity: ARB experiences mean daily volatility of ~5.5%. Despite this, the market demonstrates robust liquidity, capable of absorbing $13.5 million in ARB sales daily with a -2% price impact.Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability ResearchThe current market can absorb approximately $13.5 million in ARB sales daily with a 2% price impact, considering the combined liquidity from both on-chain and off-chain trusted sources.Mean Trading Volume: ARB’s mean trading volume over the past 30 days stands at 423 million, indicating a significant market presence and trading activity.Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability ResearchIn the past 30 days, the average daily trading volume was approximately 428.84 million ARB, equivalent to $670.43 million at the current price.DAO’s Strategic RoleOperational Capacity: The DAO treasury positions itself to add collateral to CDPs in downtrends and to liquidate ARB in uptrends, aiming to stabilize the price within a lower and upper limit.Decision-Making Process: Price levels are determined based on thorough market analysis, with the DAO adjusting its strategies in response to market conditions.Scenario Analysis: Market Stabilization in Action1. Bearish Market Scenario (Price Falling to Lower Limits):Trigger and Initial Reaction: Triggered by external market factors, the price of ARB starts to fall towards the lower limit.DAO Intervention: To prevent further downtrends as prices approach the lower limit price bracket, the DAO supplements CDP collateral. It strategically utilizes the DAO’s treasury and its capacity to provide additional collateral to avoid more sale of ARB and capping the DAO’s treasury further, preventing a further price drop due to ecosystem growth expenditure and managing spending limits more dynamically.Outcome and Analysis: This action avoids mass liquidations, thus maintaining market confidence. The intervention is particularly effective in ensuring the LTV for ARB collateral CDPs remains within the 50-70% range.2. Bullish Market Scenario (Price Approaching Upper Limits):Market Uptrend: As ARB’s price nears the upper limit, there’s potential for overheating.DAO Intervention: In this phase, the DAO implements controlled liquidations. By selling ARB systematically, it counters the rapid price increase.Optimized Dilution: The managed liquidations could prevent overheating, by providing additional selling pressure in a timely manner. The DAO’s daily expenditure of ~360,000 ARB is effectively utilized to regulate overheated market scenarios.Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability ResearchAround 358,636 ARB per day from when allocations started (August 7th, 2023) to July 31st, 2024.Expected Outcomes:This approach prevents disparity in final grant size due to price fluctuations which can lead to over and under granting by using stablecoins for settlement of grant payments.Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability - Working GroupThe current situation of paying in ARB is disadvantageous to the DAO both ways: if ARB increases we are overpaying, if it decreases the project we funded is affected.Arbitrum Treasury Management Report by AeraFor instance, this grant  intended to send 5500 USD for one of its payments. At the time of proposing this transaction in the multisig, 4,166.67 ARB was worth roughly 5500 USD. However, at the time of the transfer’s execution nearly two days later, it was worth 6233.70 USD, a whopping 13% premium that the Arbitrum DAO paid. In this case, the recipient received more ARB than they were entitled to, which is unlikely to cause complaint, but this just as easily could have gone the other way.Incorporating DAO-Owned liquidations with CDPs ensures that our average daily expenditure of 360,000 ARB is diluted appropriately. While a large proposal of 70 million ARB the price impact can be catastrophic, however, with the flexibility offered by CDPs, the DAO can leverage the market’s daily absorption capacity more effectively. In the current market scenario, the combined daily buy side liquidity is ~$13 million. When done systematically, this can allow the DAO to liquidate 360,000 ARB daily which has negligible price impact. A 70 Mil ARB grant liquidated through CDPs provides the DAO with flexibility to liquidate over 200 trading days while providing capital to grantees today. Based on these numbers and the current market scenario, the DAO could effectively double its spending in dollar terms and still avoid having a significant impact on daily trading volume.ARB buy side liquidty problem1629×657 68.4 KBImprove sell side liquidity on DEXes. By acting as a maker, the DAO can offset shallow liquidity of bids in the order book by providing sell-side liquidity. Currently, most DEXes can only absorb $135,000 worth of buy orders before the price changes by 2% or more. By using the DAO’s spending strategically, we can ensure sufficient buy-side liquidity across DEXes.Provides the opportunity to develop a versatile closed-loop mechanism that enables DAOs to transition grants into strategic investments, manifesting as either loans or equity stakes. This system offers grantees the flexibility to repay these financial instruments in a variety of forms according to the initial agreement’s terms. For loans, repayment can be made using stablecoins, reflecting a straightforward return of the borrowed funds. When the funding is provided as an investment, options for repayment expand to include returning value via a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), direct token allocations, a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), or even equity itself, depending on the nature of the initial investment and the agreement between the DAO and the grantee. This approach not only diversifies the DAO’s investment portfolio but also provides funded projects with tailored options to fulfill their obligations, thereby strengthening the ecosystem’s financial sustainability and fostering a more robust relationship between the DAO and its grantees.Treasury Impact and Risk Management StrategyThe DAO currently has an annual expenditure of 131,400,000 ARB we explore diverse scenarios to path find an optimal solution to managing the DAOs growth funding strategies using CDPs.Scenario 1: ARB as the Sole Collateral with an LTV of 50% (up to 300% net collateral)Collateral Requirements:The DAO will allocate ARB tokens equivalent to 200% of its annual spending, amounting to 262,800,000 ARB, to ensure a robust collateral ratio.An Anti-Liquidation Collateral Matching Pool will be established with 131,400,000 ARB, serving as an additional buffer to safeguard against market volatility.Total Treasury Impact:This strategy results in a total allocation of 394,200,000 ARB from the treasury, significantly enhancing the CDPs financial resilience.Scenario 2: Combined Collateral Approach with ARB and RWAs with an LTV of ~70% (up to 210% net collateral)Collateral Composition:Initial RWA allocation from Step 1 is valued at $48,650,000, based on the current VWAP of $1.39 per ARB, representing 35 million ARB.The ARB collateral ratio is adjusted to approximately 140%, totaling 183,960,000 ARB.An Anti-Liquidation Collateral Matching Pool with 96,400,000 ARB is set up to provide further market stability.Total ARB Collateral Allocation:Combining the ARB and RWA assets, the total collateral allocation reaches approximately 215%, or 280,360,000 ARB, ensuring a comprehensive risk mitigation framework.Preliminary Recommended Debt Ceiling with Real-World Assets (RWAs)In the context of incorporating Real-World Assets (RWAs) as outlined in Step 1, we propose a cautious yet strategic approach to setting our debt ceiling. This proposal is designed to ensure the Arbitrum DAO’s financial stability and solvency while optimizing our collateral framework.Proposed Debt Ceiling and Justification:•	Debt Ceiling: We recommend establishing a preliminary debt ceiling of $50 million USD. This ceiling is carefully calibrated to reflect the underlying value of RWAs committed in Step 1, providing a balanced framework for managing our CDPs responsibly.•	RWA Holdings: Our RWA holdings, valued at $48,650,000 (based on a Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of $1.39 per ARB), form the cornerstone of this proposal. These assets serve as a robust foundation to guarantee our solvency, ensuring that we have a substantial buffer to cover potential liabilities.•	Daily Liquidation Strategy: To maintain market stability and manage our debt obligations efficiently, we propose an average daily liquidation volume of $500,400 worth of ARB which is less than 4% of daily market absorption capacity of $13.5 million. This strategy is designed to minimize market impact, ensuring that we can meet our financial obligations without disrupting the ARB market.•	Settlement Turnaround Timeline: We anticipate a settlement turnaround timeline of 90 to 100 days for the debt ceiling adjustments. This timeframe allows us to navigate market conditions effectively, providing enough flexibility to adjust our strategies in response to changing market dynamics.By adopting this approach to setting our debt ceiling, we aim to balance risk management with our growth objectives. This framework not only ensures the CDP’s financial health but also ensures solvency of CDPs in the worst-case scenario.Call to ActionEngage CDP Providers: We collaborate with CDP pools to join the Arbitrum ecosystem, leveraging their liquidity to foster a robust CDP market for ARB as collateral.DAO-Managed CDP: We propose the exploration of a DAO-owned and managed CDP, which potentially offers greater capital efficiency and tighter control.ConclusionThe implementation of this CDP mechanism on Arbitrum DAO represents a step towards more resilient and flexible financial operations in the DAO’s spending. This approach not only aligns with our group’s proposed strategic objectives to facilitate DAO-Owned Liquidations but also offers significant time alpha to allow the DAO to liquidate at higher valuations. We welcome thoughts, feedback, and active participation from the community in bringing this vision to fruition."

In this report’s second half, the insights are used to assess the utility of DAO token swaps for Arbitrum.Thanks to the Thank ARB Firestarters Program powered by Thrive Protocol, which made this research possible, and everyone who provided input for this report through calls or written contributions.5 Point SummaryToken Swaps are ecosystem enablers allowing DAOs to form alliances, share upside and costs, align governance, and hedge exposure through treasury diversification.Every token swap consists of three acts: the pre-swap (exploration), the execution (ratification), and the post-swap (relationship management).Product integrations, high talent retention rates, healthy onchain treasuries on both sides, active utility of the tokens being swapped, and clearly defined milestones are the ingredients of successful token swaps. L2 blockchains swapping with dapps should have follow-on programs to make the most of token swap initiatives.After removing outliers, the value of executed token swaps considered for analysis was $89.2 million. 10 DAOs accounted for 81% of the value, with Olympus DAO executing the highest volume of swaps at 21.8%Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to engage with select grantees from LTIPP and STIP (111 possible candidates) through a 10 million ARB pilot program to gain insights on integrating token swaps as ecosystem enablers.You can read the full report here ← The report also provides a foundation for our draft Pilot Proposal: Arbitrum Token Swap Program.

This practice results in LPs receiving no fees during this toxic flow trading, which could be deemed unethical.Moreover, Arbitrum DAO is currently incentivizing LPs on Ramses with ARB tokens, which raises concerns about the fairness of this strategy and whether it’s an activity that violates the incentive program’s mandate. While one could argue that establishing MEV through arbitrage is part of the game, the practice of zeroing fees to extract these benefits could be deemed a misuse of incentives and a violation of the program.The same strategy appears to be occurring on other networks such as Scroll and Linea, but our focus here is on Arbitrum, where it seems the team has extracted about $90K thus far.Given these concerns, we would appreciate Ramses’ response and clarification on this matter, how are these fee adjustments managed and are there any considerations in place to ensure that LPs are treated fairly and no potential violations of the incentive program are occurring?"

This language-agnostic approach opens up new possibilities for developers, enabling them to use their preferred programming languages while maintaining full ABI compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.One of the most remarkable aspects of Stylus programs is their exceptional performance and cost-effectiveness. These programs are orders of magnitude cheaper and faster to execute than traditional EVM-based smart contracts while also being fully EVM compatible. This breakthrough enables Stylus programs to interact seamlessly with existing Ethereum smart contracts, creating a bridge between the efficiency of WASM and the established Ethereum ecosystem.Stylus SDK for RustThis powerful toolkit enables developers to write programs for Arbitrum chains in Rust. Rust’s combination of performance, safety, and modern features makes it ideal for developing robust and efficient smart contracts. The Stylus SDK for Rust provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions that simplify the process of creating Stylus programs. It offers a familiar development experience for Rust programmers while integrating seamlessly with the Arbitrum ecosystem. Some of the features available in the SDK include:Generic, storage-backed Rust types for programming Solidity-equivalent smart contracts with optimal storage caching.Simple macros for writing language-agnostic methods and entry points.Automatic export of Solidity interfaces for interoperability across programming languages.Powerful primitive types backed by the feature-rich Alloy.Procedural MacrosThe Stylus Rust SDK leverages several powerful procedural macros to streamline smart contract development and ensure seamless integration with the EVM ecosystem. These macros automate complex tasks such as trait implementation, method exposure, storage management, and inter-contract communication, allowing developers to write idiomatic Rust code while maintaining full compatibility with contracts made with EVM-compatible languages.entrypointThis macro defines the entry point for Stylus execution. It implements the TopLevelStorage trait and is typically used to annotate the top-level storage struct. This macro sets up the necessary boilerplate for handling incoming calls, parsing calldata, and serializing results. It also manages reentrancy protection, integrating with the Stylus VM’s execution model.externalThis macro is used to make methods “external” so that they can be called by other contracts. It implements the Router trait for the annotated impl block. The macro handles the complexities of ABI encoding and decoding, method selector generation, and integration with the Stylus VM’s calling conventions. It also manages purity annotations (pure, view, payable) and can infer these based on the method signature if not explicitly specified. This macro can have the #[inherit] attribute to implement inheritance-like behavior, allowing a contract to include methods from parent contracts.sol_interfaceIt transforms Solidity interface definitions into Rust structs and methods, enabling seamless interaction with other contracts. The macro handles method generation, type conversion, function selector calculation, and call context management. It supports various call types (pure, view, and payable) and accommodates reentrancy concerns. By automating the creation of ABI-compatible Rust code, it simplifies cross-contract communication while maintaining type safety and idiomatic Rust practices. This macro acts as a translator, enabling Rust contracts to integrate with the broader EVM ecosystem.solidity_storageThis attribute macro is applied to Rust structs to enable their use in persistent storage within a smart contract. Each field in the struct must implement the StorageType trait which ensures EVM storage model compatibility. Applying this macro allows developers to define storage layouts directly in Rust, with the fields mapping to the corresponding storage slots in the EVM. This macro ensures that the storage layout of the Rust structs aligns with that of Solidity, facilitating seamless upgrades and interactions with existing Solidity contracts. It supports nested structs and various storage types like StorageAddress, StorageBool, and custom types implementing StorageType.sol_storageThis macro enables the definition of Rust structs using Solidity-like syntax. It ensures that the storage layout of these structs is identical to their Solidity counterparts. This macro simplifies the transition from Solidity to Rust by allowing developers to reuse their Solidity type definitions directly in Rust, maintaining compatibility with existing storage layouts. This macro uses solidity_storage macro under the hood.derive_solidity_errorThis macro allows Rust enums to be used for error handling in contract methods. It enables enums to be automatically converted into Solidity-compatible error messages that can be returned by smart contract functions. Under the hood, the macro works by implementing From<YOUR_ERROR> for Vec<u8> along with printing code for export-abi.derive_eraseThis macro automatically implements the Erase trait for a struct. It generates an erase() method that calls erase() on each of the struct’s fields. This allows for easy clearing of complex storage structures in Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts, ensuring that all fields are properly erased without manual implementation. The macro cannot implement Erase for types that do not support it, such as mappings.Core ModulesThe following modules are contained within the stylus-sdk folder to facilitate smart contract development and interaction with the Stylus WASM module:abiThe abi module provides functionality for encoding and decoding data according to the Ethereum Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. It enables a two-way mapping between Solidity and Rust types, allowing for interoperability between Rust and Solidity contracts. The module supports encoding function calls into byte arrays and decoding contract responses back into Rust types. The abi module also includes utilities to generate method selectors and export Solidity interfaces, treating Vec<u8> as uint8[] in Solidity and using the Bytes type for Solidity bytes. This functionality is essential for communication between Rust-based smart contracts and those written in Solidity.callThe call module manages interactions with external contracts by handling the execution context and providing mechanisms for standard and raw contract calls. It allows developers to specify gas limits and call values, and access contract storage. The module includes caching strategies to optimize repeated state access and features for safe execution during re-entrant calls. By managing these aspects, the call module enables Rust-based contracts to interact with Ethereum contracts, facilitating contract communication and data exchange.deployThe deploy module facilitates the deployment of contracts on the Arbitrum network. It includes functionalities for both standard and raw deployments, offering flexibility and control over the deployment process. The raw.rs file provides lower-level deployment functions, allowing for more granular control and potentially unsafe operations. This module supports setting deployment parameters, handling the deployment process, and ensuring correct contract initialization.storageThe storage module provides a comprehensive framework for managing smart contract storage, featuring abstractions for common data structures like arrays, bytes, maps, and vectors. It supports both basic and complex storage operations through a set of defined traits, ensuring proper data handling and access. The module allows developers to define custom storage logic by implementing the StorageType trait, enabling more advanced data manipulation while providing persistent storage access in the Rust-based contracts. Stylus contracts run on a virtual machine that shares the same EVM State Trie, allowing access to Ethereum’s key-value storage. The module provides types and traits for safe storage access using Rust’s borrow checker, preventing unsafe aliasing of storage.hostioThe hostio module facilitates interactions between Rust-based smart contracts and the host environment on the Arbitrum blockchain. It provides a set of functions for managing contract state, executing calls, and handling I/O operations via a foreign-function interface to the Stylus WASM VM which ultimately communicates with the core blockchain. The wrap_hostio macro is a key component of this module, designed to simplify and streamline the process of defining host functions. It wraps low-level host operations in Rust-safe abstractions, automatically generating bindings to interact with the blockchain. Several single-file modules in the Stylus SDK provide typical blockchain interactions extensively using the wrap_hostio module, such as:block: Provides access to Ethereum block information, including properties like the block number, timestamp, and miner details. It serves as an interface for retrieving data about the current or past blocks on the blockchain.contract: Facilitates interactions with other contracts, enabling function calls and access to contract metadata. It allows contracts to perform operations such as balance checks and contract code retrieval.crypto: Offers cryptographic functions and utilities, such as hashing algorithms and signature verification.evm: Interfaces with the EVM, managing execution resources and logging. It includes utilities to query remaining gas and ink (Stylus-specific compute units), emit logs both in raw and alloy-typed forms, and manage memory growth.msg: Handles message-passing operations, providing information about the current transaction, such as the sender, value, and gas. It allows contracts to interact with transaction data and control flow.tx: Provides transaction-related functionality, including accessing transaction details like gas price and origin. It enables contracts to work with transaction-specific data and execute transaction-based logic.Mini AllocatorThis allocator is key to the Stylus ecosystem, optimized for wasm32 targets like Arbitrum Stylus. It uses a minimal bump allocator strategy, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency. Notably, mini-alloc never deallocates memory, which is ideal for scenarios with tight binary size constraints where it is acceptable to leak all allocations. This design choice enhances performance, aligning with Stylus’ focus on optimizing for blockchain environments where traditional memory management can add unnecessary overhead.ExamplesThe Arbitrum Stylus SDK repository contains three example crates of common smart contract designs: erc20, erc721, and single_call.erc20: Demonstrates an ERC-20 token contract with functionalities like minting, transferring, and checking balances. It includes methods for token transfers and managing allowances.erc721: Illustrates an ERC-721 NFT contract implementation, covering minting, transferring, and querying ownership of unique tokens. It also handles token metadata and ensures compatibility with the ERC-721 standard.single_cal: Showcases a simple contract for making a single call to another contract, demonstrating inter-contract communication within the Arbitrum environment using the Stylus SDK.Trust AssumptionsSDK Integrity: It is assumed that the Stylus SDK itself is free from malicious code, such as backdoors or other vulnerabilities that could circumvent the behavior of the underlying blockchain. The SDK is expected to function as described in its documentation, ensuring that developers can rely on its behavior as intended.WASM VM and Stylus Module Compliance: It is assumed that the WASM VM and Stylus module strictly follow the consensus rules as outlined by the core EVM part of Arbitrum. This ensures that the execution within the Stylus environment is consistent with the broader consensus rules governing the Arbitrum network, maintaining the integrity and reliability of smart contract execution.Third-Party Dependencies: Any third-party libraries or dependencies integrated with the Stylus SDK are trusted to be secure and regularly updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.Smart Contract Interfaces: It is assumed that the ABIs generated by the Stylus SDK for contracts are correct and that smart contracts behave in an expected manner, similar to Solidity contracts. This means that from an external perspective, the contracts should exhibit predictable and standard behavior, ensuring compatibility and reliability for the users interacting with them.Critical SeverityStorage Layout is Inconsistent with SolidityThe documentation asserts that struct fields in Stylus will map to the same storage slots as in EVM programming languages and that the layout will be identical to Solidity’s. This suggests that upgrading from Solidity to Rust should not cause misalignment in storage slots, thereby implying an easy transfer of type definitions.However, Stylus does not handle inherited storage in the same manner as Solidity. For example, consider the following Solidity code:contract Parent {   bool a = true;   bool b = true;}contract Child is Parent {   bool c = true;   bool d = true;}In this case, storage slot 0 contains 0x01010101. In contrast, the equivalent Stylus code uses a borrow clause that uses a new storage slot and does not pack the state variables, which results in a different storage layout:// Snippet of parent.rssol_storage! {    pub struct Parent {        bool a;        bool b;    }}// Snippet of lib.rssol_storage! {       #[entrypoint]    struct Child {        #[borrow]        Parent parent;        bool c;         bool d;    }}#[external]#[inherit(Parent)]impl Child {// ...}Given the same value set, this results in 0x0101 being in slot 0 and 0x0101 being in slot 1.This discrepancy is critical for projects using proxy patterns that are migrating from Solidity to Stylus as it could lead to storage layout misalignment, potentially overwriting state variables.Consider refactoring the solidity_storage macro to mirror Solidity’s behavior. Alternatively, consider updating the documentation to accurately reflect the current behavior and avoid misleading developers.Update: Resolved at commits a99d8c5 and 6e3a62e. Inline documentation has been added to highlight the discrepancy with Solidity storage layout.Lack of Selector Collision Check in External MacroOne of the functions of the external macro is to automate the exposure of Rust functions within a Stylus smart contract as Ethereum-compatible methods. To achieve this, it analyzes an implementation block, processes each method to generate its selectors, and then uses these selectors to route incoming calls to the appropriate Rust functions.However, the macro does not validate the uniqueness of these selectors. This oversight can lead to selector collisions, resulting in methods becoming unreachable. In addition, developers can manually set a custom selector for a function using #[selector(id = <NUMBER_THAT_GENERATES_THE_COLLISION>)], potentially duplicating existing selectors intentionally or unintentionally. This vulnerability can be exploited to create malicious contracts, such as honeypots, wherein methods are intentionally made unreachable.Consider implementing a validation mechanism within this macro to ensure that all selectors are unique, preventing selector collisions and enhancing contract reliability and security. One approach could be to add a #[deny(unreachable_patterns)] statement on the route function to prevent unreachable methods.Update: Partially resolved at commits a78decd and 0d50c1d. The suggested solution of using #[deny(unreachable_patterns)] is insufficient, as it only checks for unreachable patterns within the specific match statement where it is applied. It does not account for selector collisions with functions from inherited contracts, allowing these conflicts to go undetected. Offchain Labs has added inline documentation to highlight this potential issue, and warnings will also be included on the documentation website. The Offchain Labs team is exploring alternative approaches to implementing inheritance for Stylus.High SeverityPotential Misuse of sol_interface MacroThe sol_interface macro allows developers to seamlessly call Solidity contracts from Stylus smart contracts using their native interfaces. However, this macro can be easily manipulated to mislead users about the actual state mutability of functions. For example, a malicious user could capitalize the first letter of the view or pure keywords, use homoglyphs, or employ other tricks to deceive users into believing that a function is non-mutating even though the macro treats that function as state-changing. This fallback to treating the function as state-changing occurs if no valid mutability keyword is detected, thereby opening the doors to unintentional errors and hard-to-detect scams.To mitigate this issue, consider implementing stricter validation within the macro to ensure that only the correct mutability keywords are permitted. This will help prevent both intentional misuse and accidental errors, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the macro.Update: Resolved at commit a474666.Custom Selectors Could Facilitate Proxy Selector Clashing AttackStylus allows developers to modify the selector for a given function using the selector attribute, which can accept either a string name or a u32 ID. This feature facilitates changing the name of a function while maintaining the same selector, simulating Solidity overloading capabilities and enabling the creation of language-agnostic contract standards.However, providing an ID may result in a function selector that exists in both an implementation contract and its proxy contract. Thus, a user may call a proxy contract function with a selector matching the intended implementation contract function instead, causing unintended code execution and precluding the user from accessing the functionality of the implementation contract. This scenario can occur if an ID integer is defined in such a way that, when converted to hex, it matches the function selector in the other contract, whether it is the implementation or the proxy.This vulnerability enables malicious projects to create hard-to-detect backdoors. In contrast to Stylus, Solidity requires finding function signatures with matching selectors before exploiting this vulnerability, which is not trivial. Even if such function signatures are found, they are likely to raise red flags due to nonsensical names in the codebase. In Stylus, this attack is harder to execute when the name option is used instead of ID which makes such scams easier to detect.Custom selectors can also confuse third-party monitoring or indexing services that use function selectors to identify specific functions. These services may rely on standard selectors, which are part of the standards or belong to community databases such as the 4byte directory. If contracts use custom selectors, these services may fail to recognize and monitor transactions, leading to errors.Given these risks, reconsider the ID option and consider accepting only the name instead. If the benefits of custom selectors do not outweigh the risks, consider removing them entirely.Update: Resolved at commit 795d376.Medium SeverityFunction Overriding Does Not Enforce Mutability RulesIn Stylus, when an inheriting contract overrides a base function in its parent, there are no checks to enforce any mutability rules. For example:A function that does not modify the state in the parent (e.g., a view function) can be overridden by one that does so in the child.A function marked payable in the parent can be overridden by a non-payable function in the child, causing the child function to revert upon receiving ETH.From a developer standpoint, this can lead to unexpected behavior and error-prone contract development since this does not match the rules enforced in Solidity, which mandate stricter mutability enforcement. To align with Solidity’s mutability rules and avoid unexpected behavior, consider refactoring the logic in the external macro by implementing checks on the mutability attributes in parent functions.Update: Resolved at commit 1984d8a.Multiple Interface Definitions in sol_interface Block Repeat FunctionsIf two or more interface definitions are present in the same sol_interface! block, subsequent interfaces will be expanded to include method definitions from the previous ones. For example:sol_interface! {    interface IService {        function makePayment(address user) payable returns (string);        function getConstant() pure returns (bytes32);    }    interface ITree {}}The expanded Rust interface for ITree will include make_payment and get_constant, allowing calls to ITree.make_payment, for example, in the contract logic. This could allow malicious developers to hide the interface of ITree, including functions from previous interface definitions that could then be called on subsequent ones. Moreover, if ITree includes its own legitimate definition of makePayment, the code will fail to compile because the implementation block will include two function definitions of the same name.Consider modifying the sol_interface macro by moving the method_impls declaration inside the first for loop so that it does not retain tokens from the previous methods during iteration.Update: Resolved at commit a64c058.Contracts Without at Least One Return Type Fail to Compile With export-abi FeatureThe export-abi feature can be used in the Stylus SDK to generate a Solidity ABI for Stylus contracts using the cargo stylus export-abi command within the contract crate. With this feature, the return statement is skipped in the [#external] macro so that the fmt_abi can be added to the returned router implementation. However, if the contract does not contain at least one function with an explicit return type (e.g., U256), the code will fail to compile due to an error in the type_decls token stream which is expanded in fmt_abi. This occurs when there are no return types because types is an empty array and type_decls attempts to loop over  [].iter(). Since the compiler cannot infer the expected type from an empty iterator, attempting to access fields like id on an unknown type (&_) leads to errors.Consider including type_decls within the fmt_abi generation process only when at least one type is available.Update: Resolved at commit 31995da.Unnecessary and Problematic Storage Types in StylusThe Stylus language supports storage types such as StorageU1 and StorageI1, which are not present in Solidity. These types do not provide any clear benefits within the SDK and fail to work properly with arrays and vectors. The density function, heavily utilized with arrays and vectors, triggers a division-by-zero error when interacting with these storage types. In addition, types like StorageBlockHash and StorageBlockNumber also lack clear utility.Consider providing detailed explanations of the use cases and relevance of these storage types. If their benefits cannot be demonstrated, it is advisable to remove them to avoid confusion and potential interoperability errors.Update: Resolved at commit 3f511fa.Inefficient Storage of Strings and BytesStylus allows for the use of both strings and dynamically-sized bytes in contract storage. However, the current implementation is notably inefficient for such types. Specifically, the functions for setting (e.g., extend) and retrieving (e.g., get_bytes) strings or dynamic bytes operate byte-by-byte, which results in a high number of SLOAD and SSTORE operations. This inefficiency is especially noticeable with longer strings or byte arrays, leading to significantly increased gas costs.Consider refactoring storage operations for strings and dynamic bytes to optimize gas usage. Possible approaches include pre-allocating storage space when appropriate; writing data in full, 32-byte words where possible; and minimizing the number of storage operations.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:Work is ongoing for this issue but needs some additional testing.Verification Challenges in Contracts May Facilitate ScamsThe Stylus SDK allows developers to create smart contracts for Arbitrum chains using the Rust programming language which is then compiled to WASM and deployed alongside Solidity contracts. However, the final WASM output is influenced by several factors, including the Rust version, enabled features, dependencies, and more. These variations make the build process nearly non-deterministic across different operating systems and architectures. This non-determinism complicates contract verification, which is crucial for establishing trust and reliability in the contract. Without consistent build outputs, it becomes challenging to ensure that the deployed WASM accurately reflects the intended contract’s code. A malicious actor could exploit this by altering the SDK to compile WASM files that do not function as expected, even if the smart contract code appears to be secure.Consider standardizing the build process by specifying and enforcing clear guidelines and issuing notifications to developers early in the development cycle (instead of doing it post-deployment). This will streamline contract verification and enhance user trust in the contract’s integrity.Update: Resolved at commit be51b58. The fix has been made on the cargo-stylus repository.Insufficient Test CoverageThe workspace currently contains only a limited number of unit tests for the abi module and the mini-alloc crate. The remainder of the codebase lacks unit tests entirely along with any integration tests. This limited test coverage may lead to undetected issues and hinder the verification of code functionality across various modules.Consider adding a robust test suite that includes comprehensive unit and integration tests for all modules. This will help ensure proper interaction between different parts of the system.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:We are currently working on adding a full suite of unit tests for the SDK as well as other items outlined in issue #148.Missing receive and fallback FunctionsThe absence of receive and fallback functions in Stylus, a language designed to be interoperable with Solidity, can have several significant implications. In Solidity, the receive function handles direct transfers of ETH to a contract. Without this function, contracts cannot accept plain ETH transfers, thereby limiting ETH transfers to those including data which triggers a specific function call. For example, contracts like PaymentSplitter will only work for externally owned accounts (EOAs) due to the lack of a receive function. In addition, many proxy patterns rely on the fallback function to forward calls to another contract. Without a fallback function, implementing upgradable contracts or beacon proxy patterns becomes much more complex, requiring alternative mechanisms to delegate calls to other contracts.Consider implementing receive and fallback functions to ensure full compatibility with Solidity contracts. Doing this will help increase code flexibility and support different proxy patterns.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:Implementation underway. Needs further testing. Progress can be tracked on issue #150.Solidity Interfaces in Stylus Might Mislead Users into Thinking They Match Solidity’s FeaturesThe sol_interface macro in Stylus smart contracts allows developers to nearly copy and paste Solidity interfaces for seamless contract interactions. However, the current implementation has some potential pitfalls. While it permits elements such as interface inheritance, events, and errors within the interfaces, these are silently ignored, with only the functions being processed. This behavior can lead to confusion and errors, as the contract compiles without issue despite these unsupported elements.To address this issue, consider documenting the sol_interface macro’s current limitations to set appropriate user expectations and implementing checks to revert when unsupported syntax is detected. If feasible, consider including these additional features in future updates as it could enhance the overall code functionality.Update: Resolved at commits 821b7f6 and be6306c.Potential Misuse of Purity AttributesIn Stylus, contract methods can be marked with attributes such as #[view], #[write], and #[pure] to explicitly define how they interact with the contract state. However, there are two ways malicious users can mislead users or third-party services regarding these attributes:Malicious users can use colons in the attribute names, like #[::pure], #[stylus::view], or any other name with colons, to bypass the checks enforced by the external macro. This allows them to misrepresent the function’s intention.Functions that do not modify the state, such as #[pure] and #[view] methods, can be incorrectly marked with the #[write] attribute without even requiring colons. The inline documentation of the macro contains this information, but it should be fixed.To prevent these issues, consider adding proper validations to the external macro to enforce correct usage of these attributes.Update: Resolved at commit d44d94f. The Offchain Labs team removed the mutability specifiers (except #[payable]), as they can be inferred from the &self/&mut self or the absence of self. This change simplifies the code by leveraging Rust’s syntax. Since methods using &self or those without self can still modify the state of other contracts—or even their own state if reentrancy is enabled—through external calls, the team has thoroughly documented this behavior in the codebase to inform users.Low SeverityUnclear Documentation Concerning CallThere are several instances in the documentation and code comments that are unclear or contradictory with respect to the difference between Call::new and Call:new_in. For example, Call::new is given as a simple example to show how to configure gas and value. However, new is only available with the reentrant flag enabled. The reasoning behind this is unclear since this comment says that new_in should be used for re-entrant calls. Other confusing comments in the documentation include:Note too that Call::new_in should be used instead of Call::new since the former provides access to storage. Code that previously compiled with reentrancy disabled may require modification in order to type-check. This is done to ensure storage changes are persisted and that the storage cache is properly managed before calls.Consider clearly documenting the difference between Call::new and Call::new_in, and what storage access patterns they represent, and modify code comments accordingly.Update: Resolved at commit ba3472f.Unclear Usage and Documentation For Storage Context During CallsTo set up a calling context with Call::new_in, the storage argument must implement TopLevelStorage. The usual pattern to create this implementation is to use the entrypoint macro, but this is not always desired if there are multiple contracts within a crate. Without TopLevelStorage, &self and &mut self are no longer available, and cumbersome workarounds are required, such as adding an empty implementation for TopLevelStorage. For example:unsafe impl TopLevelStorage for Contract {}Furthermore, it is unclear what the purpose of the storage argument is when using Call::new_in since the call function never actually uses this attribute of the call context.Consider updating the code comments and documentation to clearly describe the purpose of the storage argument. In addition, consider alternative implementations of the Call::new_in function to accommodate contracts that do not implement the TopLevelStorage trait.Update: Resolved at commit ba3472f.Misleading DocumentationThroughout the codebase, multiple instances of inaccurate or misleading documentation were identified:The inline documentation for the set function in StorageBlockNumber is identical to that of the get method, causing confusion about their distinct functionalities.The documentation for the raw_log function advises users to prefer the alloy-typed raw_log, but it should actually recommend using the log function instead.Consider correcting the documentation to align with the code’s behavior. This will help improve the clarity and readability of the codebase.Update: Resolved at commit dc1e9c5.Information Leakage in WASM BuildThe WASM output of a Stylus contract includes sensitive metadata, such as the username of the individual who compiled the contract and partial paths from the home directory. Although this information does not pose a direct security risk, it can be leveraged by attackers for social engineering or other targeted attacks.Consider removing or obfuscating such information from production builds to maintain privacy and reduce the potential attack surface. Stripping metadata from the WASM output can help mitigate these risks without impacting the functionality of the deployed contract.Update: Resolved at commit 00abf34. The fix has been made on the cargo-stylus repository.Inefficient Allocator Fallback in Stylus ContractsIn Stylus contracts, the mini-alloc allocator module from the SDK is intended to be the standard allocator due to its performance. This module is included in every example and default template provided by the SDK, ensuring that developers are guided towards using the most efficient option. However, the declaration of the global allocator, which specifies the use of mini-alloc, can be removed inadvertently. If this happens, the contract defaults to using the allocator from the standard library, which is significantly less efficient. Consequently, contracts deployed using this allocator will be very gas-inefficient.Consider enforcing mini-alloc as the default allocator across all Stylus contracts. Changes to the allocator should only be permitted through a deliberate and evident action to avoid unintentional fallback to the less-efficient standard library allocator.Update: Resolved at commit 2354799.Macro Implementations Missing Proper DocstringsIn the stylus-proc folder, the files that hold the implementations for each macro are missing proper docstrings.Given the complexity and length of the code, consider adding detailed docstrings. This will make it easier for readers and developers to better understand the inner workings of the codebase while improving the overall code maintainability as well.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:We are looking to refactor our procedural macro implementations to make them more easily testable and easier to understand. This will include better internal documentation of their implementations. Progress may be tracked on issue #151Misleading Methods in RawDeployThe limit_revert_data and skip_revert_data methods set the offset and size fields of the RawDeploy instance. However, these fields are never used in the deploy function, rendering these methods redundant. This issue is significant because it misleads developers into believing that they can control the amount of revert data returned, whereas, in reality, these methods have no impact on the deployment’s outcome.Consider removing these methods and fields or modifying the deploy function to utilize these fields.Update: Resolved at commit 6e21166.Potential Misuse of #[borrow] Attribute in Storage FieldsThe #[borrow] attribute is used on storage fields to implement the Borrow and BorrowMut traits for specific types, facilitating inheritance in Stylus contracts. However, its application can extend to state variables that do not represent the storage of the parent contract, leading to issues.The primary concern is the incorrect semantic meaning when #[borrow] is used on simple types. This attribute is designed for complex types that represent a subset of the contract’s storage, not for individual storage slots. Such usage misrepresents the attribute’s purpose, misleading developers about the storage layout or contract composition. Furthermore, it generates additional trait implementations that are unnecessary for simple storage types, causing unnecessary code bloat and potentially increasing the contract size without any benefit.Consider allowing the use of the #[borrow] attribute exclusively for fields that genuinely represent a subset of a contract’s storage. This ensures accurate semantic representation while avoiding misleading code and unnecessary trait implementations.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:Work is ongoing on this issue, and we are searching for a solution that works in Rust. Progress may be tracked on issue #149Deprecate constant State Mutability in sol_interface MacroThe sol_interface macro currently allows users to define Solidity interfaces with methods marked as constant for state mutability. However, starting from Solidity version 0.5.0, the constant keyword for functions is no longer supported and has been replaced by view and pure. While the macro internally converts functions with the constant keyword to pure, retaining the constant keyword can be misleading.To align with the later Solidity versions and avoid incorrect mutability assumptions, consider updating the sol_interface macro to disallow the use of the constant keyword for function state mutability. This change will help ensure compatibility with modern Solidity versions and enhance code correctness.Update: Resolved at commit e173182.sol_interface Improper Handling of Function VisibilityIn Solidity, it is mandatory to specify the visibility of a function within an interface, and it should always be external. The sol_interface macro in Stylus, which processes these Solidity interfaces, currently allows users to include methods with incorrect visibility attributes, such as public, or omit the visibility attribute altogether. This non-compliance with Solidity standards could lead to confusion among developers.Consider adding validation to ensure that the external keyword is present in function definitions. This would align with Solidity’s interface requirements and prevent potential misunderstanding.Update: Resolved at commit 2330ac7.sol_interface Lacks Support for Struct and Enum TypesThe sol_interface macro is designed to enable developers to seamlessly call Solidity contracts from Stylus smart contracts using their native interfaces. However, it currently does not support struct and enum types, which are commonly used in Solidity. This limitation forces developers to use less readable workarounds, potentially leading to accidental errors and reduced code maintainability.Consider implementing support for structs and enums. This would significantly enhance developer experience and ensure full compatibility with Solidity interfaces.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:Work has begun on struct support in sol_interface!. More testing is required for release, and enums should be implemented as well. Progress may be tracked on issue #74.sol_storage! Macro Does Not Support Private State VariablesPrivate state variables help enforce encapsulation by restricting direct access, ensuring that variables are only modified through controlled functions. This approach minimizes the attack surface and prevents unintended side effects or inconsistencies.Currently, when using the sol_storage! macro, state variables cannot be set as private, allowing child contracts to access and modify these variables directly. Developers must instead use the #[solidity_storage] macro, which supports private state variables.To maintain consistency with #[solidity_storage], consider enhancing the sol_storage! macro to support private state variables. Alternatively, this limitation should be clearly documented in the official documentation.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:We will consider private state variables for the sol_storage! macro as part of the work for N-04, tracked by issue #147.Notes & Additional InformationNaming IssuesThroughout the codebase, multiple instances of elements that could be renamed to better reflect their purpose were identified:The topics parameter in the emit_log function should be renamed to number_topics to better reflect the nature of the value it represents.The #[external] macro, which allows methods to be callable by other methods within the contract or external accounts, should be renamed to #[public]. The current name might be confused with Solidity’s external visibility, which implies that the function cannot be called from within the contract.The #[solidity_storage] macro should be renamed to #[persistent_storage], #[storage], or #[state]. Instead, the wrapper macro currently named sol_storage should adopt the name solidity_storage, as it relates more to Solidity’s syntax.The types module name suggests the existence of multiple types. However, if only Address is defined, the module should be renamed to AddressType. Alternatively, if additional common types are expected to be added, consider specifying these to avoid confusion.Consider addressing these naming issues to improve the readability of the codebase.Update: Resolved at commit 8d1699f. The Offchain Labs team decided to keep both the sol_storage! macro and the types module with the same name. The former aligns with the sol! macro from alloy, while the latter will include additional types in an upcoming release.wee_alloc Crate is Unmaintained and VulnerableThe wee_alloc crate, a minimal allocator for WebAssembly, is no longer actively maintained, with the last release being over three years ago. Moreover, two of its maintainers have indicated that they do not plan to continue supporting the crate. As a result, several open issues, including memory leaks, remain unresolved.Even though the crate is not currently used for wasm32 targets, consider switching to a more actively maintained and safer alternative such as lol_alloc or the default Rust standard allocator.Update: Resolved at commit 80bfcba.Unstable License URL ReferenceThe license URL comment at the top of nearly every file in the scope points to a specific branch (stylus) in the GitHub repository. This branch is not the main branch and may change or be deleted in the future. If the branch name changes or the license is relocated, the current URL references will become invalid, leading to broken links.Consider updating the license URL to point to a more stable reference, such as a specific commit or tag. Alternatively, consider including a note that the branch name may change. These measures will help ensure that the URL remains functional over time.Update: Resolved at commit 0a0ace1.Limited Functionality in sol_storage MacroThe sol_storage macro currently allows users to define state variables in a Solidity-like syntax within their smart contracts. However, it does not fully replicate Solidity’s syntax, notably lacking support for specifying visibility, as well as defining constants and immutables. This limitation prevents things like the automatic generation of getters using the public keyword and makes it difficult to define constants and immutables as seamlessly as in Solidity.Consider extending the functionality of the sol_storage macro to support these features. Utilizing the syn_solidity crate could facilitate this enhancement by providing a more comprehensive parsing and handling of Solidity-like syntax.Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The Offchain Labs team stated:We are considering these additional features for the sol_storage! macro. Progress can be tracked in issue #147.Lack of Length Accessor for Fixed-Size ArraysIn Solidity, both fixed-size and dynamic arrays support the .length property, allowing developers to easily determine the size of an array. However, in Stylus, there is no built-in method to access the length of fixed-size arrays. This functionality is available only for dynamic arrays (referred to as vectors in Stylus). This absence of a length accessor for fixed-size arrays may lead to inconsistencies and additional complexity in array management.Consider implementing a built-in method to access the length of fixed-size arrays in Stylus, similar to the .length property in Solidity. This enhancement would simplify array handling and reduce the risk of errors.Update: Resolved at commit 8ab7650.Unresolved Link to EagerStorageThe link to super::EagerStorage in traits.rs is broken as no item named EagerStorage exists in the storage module.Consider updating or removing the broken link to ensure accurate documentation and avoid confusion for developers.Update: Resolved at commit 9b221c8.Typographical ErrorsThroughout the codebase, multiple instances of typographical errors were identified:inheritence should be inheritance.occured should be occurred.Consider fixing the aforementioned typographical errors in order to improve the readability of the codebase.Update: Resolved at commit 5052d30.External Macro Attribute Handling InconsistencyThe external macro currently accepts attributes that are not utilized in its implementation. This can lead to confusion, especially in comparison to the entrypoint macro which throws an error if it receives any attributes.To ensure consistency and reduce potential confusion, consider adding validation to the external macro implementation to reject any attributes.Update: Resolved at commit a1267bf.Outdated Copyright YearOutdated copyright years may not reflect recent modifications or ongoing development. Several files within the codebase have outdated copyright years, including the license file. Other examples include:tx.rslib.rsblock.rsConsider updating all outdated copyrights to signal active maintenance and attention to detail.Update: Resolved at commit d57458d.Todo Comments in the CodeDuring development, having well-described TODO comments will make the process of tracking and solving them easier. Without this information, these comments might age and important information for the security of the system might be forgotten by the time it is released to production. These comments should be tracked in the project’s issue backlog and resolved before the system is deployed.Throughout the codebase, multiple instances of TODO comments were identified:Line 31 and Line 270 of external.rsLine 279 of proc.rsConsider removing all instances of TODO comments and instead tracking them in the issues backlog. Alternatively, consider linking each inline TODO comment to the corresponding issues backlog entry.Update: Resolved at commit 73dbc1c.ConclusionThe Stylus SDK allows smart contract developers to build applications for the Arbitrum ecosystem using the Rust language. These Stylus programs are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and can be deployed on-chain to run alongside Solidity smart contracts. This innovative approach aims to combine the efficiency of WASM execution with the robustness of programming in Rust, all the while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.During the security audit of the Stylus SDK, we discovered numerous security issues and also made extensive recommendations for the improvement of the overall design. The project is clearly still under development, having several features that are either non-functional or contain bugs. However, the development team showed a strong commitment to addressing these concerns and we encourage them to continue their efforts. Once all the identified issues are resolved, further improvements are made, and the project reaches a more mature stage, we strongly recommend the team to consider conducting a follow-up audit to ensure comprehensive security.Despite the current challenges, we see great potential in the Stylus SDK. We look forward to seeing how the project evolves, particularly as the team addresses the identified issues and continues to refine the SDK. We believe that further development of the Stylus SDK could introduce exciting new possibilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the broader world of smart contract development."

How can we increase data availability and accessibility without losing decentralisation?”Members: Aman and Rashmi AbbigeriTeam Lead contact name or alias: Aman (Telegram: amanwithwings)PITCH: daoURI for Arbitrum DAO🚀 | LoomAbstractWe propose that the Arbitrum DAO takes control of its data by publishing a daoURI onchain. The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.DAOstar received a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal. Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.MotivationThe Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs, and there is a lot of data surrounding it. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the “outside”. For example, consider the following questions:Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research & Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be https://www.arbwallets.xyz/)Can you share a status update on the DAO’s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I’m not sure!)For an active participant, these answers might not be very hard. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.There are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.Adopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:{""@context"": ""http://www.daostar.org/schemas"",""type"": ""DAO"",""name"": ""<name of the DAO>"",""description"": ""<description>"",""membersURI"": ""<URI>"",""proposalsURI"": ""<URI>"",""activityLogURI"": ""<URI>"",""governanceURI"": ""<URI>"",""contractsRegistryURI"": ""<URI>""}It contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, the daoURI creates an “official repository” of information on the DAO.Here are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:1600×847 168 KBto this:1600×842 171 KBWe can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyoneFor example, Arbitrum DAO’s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari’s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free). By making access to this information easy, we can greatly improve the DAO’s transparency. i.e, go from: 1600×786 291 KBto this:1600×903 249 KBdaoURI makes it much easier to structure metadata improvements.A specific example that surfaced during Arbitrum GovHack (thanks to Paulo Fonseca): onchain proposals at Arbitrum DAO (or any DAO for that matter) do not reference a forum discussion. This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.To summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth for metadata, that can represent the present state of the DAO, and is easily accessible for onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It’s a step in the right direction with no downside.RationaleThis proposal aligns with the Arbitrum’s mission and community values, by making the Arbitrum DAO more open, accessible, and inclusive to participants and tools alike. The initiative:significantly lowers the high threshold of context and background work required to start understanding and meaningfully contributing to the DAO;It increases accountability over the board as more information is now freely available;It decreases administrative overhead and maintenance as were converging on a single point to publish and consume data.SpecificationsExecution is a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory which deploys a new registration contract that’ll store the daoURI. The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO’s Governor timelock as admin, and managers as the DAO decides.A DAO that runs the same configuration as Arbitrum DAO and has adopted EIP-4824 is Unlock Protocol. We are adding that transaction here for reference, along with successful proposals at Treasure and 1inch that were executed through their respective treasury safes.Steps to ImplementCreate a daoURI for Arbitrum DAO: Based on conversations with different contributors during the Arbitrum GovHack, the daoURI can include a description on the DAO, a paginated list of all DAO voters, a list of all proposals (with title, timestamp, status and soon a discussion link), link to governance documents, list of all contracts owned or managed by the DAO, link to dashboards on protocol revenue, orbit chains and delegate performance. It will be stored on IPFS.Note that this is a starting point. The daoURI of Arbitrum DAO will continuously evolve and become more comprehensive over time.Publish the daoURI onchain: As detailed in the execution summary above, this will be a simple smart contract call to deploy a new contract on Arbitrum One.Maintain the daoURI: Though daoURI is fully manageable through governance, it may not be practically feasible to initiate an onchain vote for every upgrade. To solve this, the DAO can set one or many manager to manage its daoURI. The Arbitrum Foundation might be a good candidate. If needed, DAOstar can commit to maintaining Arbitrum DAO’s daoURI for a year for at additional cost. Managers can only update daoURIs. They can be added or removed easily by the DAO.To keep the daoURI a community-led effort, we suggest that whoever is set as a manager maintain a forum topic to discuss updates. That way, any Arbitrum DAO member can publicly request to add a missing piece of info to the daoURI.TimelineCreation of daoURI V0.1 (includes conversations with delegates, service providers, the Arbitrum Foundation, and all other participants through the forum, led by DAOstar): 4 weeksTesting (ensuring that the subURIs work well & that any static data is either uploaded to IPFS or hosted by a trusted 3rd party, for example the Arbitrum Foundation): 2 weeksOverall: 6 weeks before the proposal is ready to be executedOverall CostThis proposal does not require any transfer of funds from the DAO treasury.Special thanks to @Bobbay, @Matt_StableLab, @raam, @coolhorsegirl, @Srijith-Questbook, @Sinkas, Hayden (BlockworksResearch) and Nick Nahaghi (Hats) for feedback and edits; @krst, @AlexLumley, @Frisson, @dk3, and George Beall (Gauntlet) for the expert sessions, and to Klaus and the rest of the GovHack team for making an awesome event happen at Brussels!EIP-4824 has already been adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, Optimism Collective (through the Optimism Foundation), and multiple frameworks and DAOs.

This proposal aims to further diversify the Arbitrum DAO treasury by including medium and high-risk profile assets, thereby reducing its dependence on the crypto-native asset, ARB.MotivationAs of July 6th, we have observed that the Arbitrum DAO treasury consists of a total of 3,164,180,268 ARB and 13,943 ETH. This means that the Arbitrum DAO treasury is 97.9% dependent on ARB, a crypto-native asset. To prevent the DAO treasury from being affected by the inherent volatility of crypto-native assets, it is necessary to diversify the treasury. During this diversification, choosing products that provide real-world yields is ideal for reducing the treasury’s exposure to the price dynamics of the crypto market. Therefore, we should diversify the Arbitrum treasury through RWAs903×558 18.8 KBSource: Arbiscan | ARB Wallet & ETH WalletRationaleIn a report prepared by karpatkey in January 2024, the value of the Arbitrum DAO treasury was stated to be $6,464,800,485. Nearly six months later, it is observed that the current value of the Arbitrum treasury has declined to $2,005,233,114. To ensure the sustainable development of the Arbitrum ecosystem and to continue providing incentives to various public goods, protocols, and users in the future as well as in the present, it is necessary to diversify the assets in the treasury. The graph below shows the value of the treasury over time.1546×1004 48.3 KBSource: deepdao.ioSpecificationsThe Arbitrum community has shown significant interest in RWAs, motivated by the need to diversify their heavily skewed portfolio. Emphasizing the importance of diversification, it is crucial to focus on investing in low-risk asset classes within RWAs.For asset diversification that the Arbitrum Treasury could undertake in the near future, RWAs are significant as a yield/revenue tool outside the dynamics of the crypto market. RWAs offer a risk-manageable approach with different financial instruments, allow for diversification within the same asset class, enable both liquid and illiquid strategies, and provide a realistic risk environment for a long-term runway. Therefore, they could play an important role within the Arbitrum treasury.Low Risk RWA Yield Strategies:Stablecoins, US Treasury Bills and US Government Securities1% of the Arbitrum Treasury will be allocated to protocol-based stablecoins, US Treasury Bills, and US Government Securities as the first step towards implementation and long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum Treasury.Starting with a bearish yield expectation of 4-5% APY, timelines can be determined based on the chosen method. For the integration of RWA diversification within the long-term strategy of the Arbitrum Treasury, the following can be achieved:More flexible implementationAs non-custodial as possibleMeeting current needsReferring to the previous proposal, Securitize BUIDL - 11 millionOndo USDY - 6 millionSuperstate USTB - 6 millionMountain USDM - 4 millionOpenEden TBill - 4 millionBacked Finance bIB01 - 4 million1600×520 194 KBSource: rwa.xyzMedium Risk RWA Yield Strategies:Tokenized Private CreditsOne of the emerging RWA approaches in DeFi is tokenized private credits, which actively offer annual interest returns ranging from 7% to 17% for various credit needs. As an implementation pathway, additional due diligence can be conducted on the methods established by teams such as Goldfinch and Untangled. This will help minimize risk and prevent investments that seem 'too good to be true”.High Risk RWA Yield Strategies:Tokenized Micro Credits & Real Estate & Stocks & Carbon CreditsStocksMostly, tokens created pegged through Backed Finance are matched one-to-one with the assets they are backed by. Currently, the total value of tokenized stocks is quite low, at around $4.48M. Therefore, these highly risky and trust-dependent assets fall within the high-risk profile category.Real EstateMany projects aim to tokenize assets in the real estate sector to enable investments by multiple participants. The most prominent among these projects are CitaDAO and Alta. In this proposal, the decision on which intermediary project to work with and the associated risks will be determined based on the research report to be prepared in the near future.Carbon CreditsToucan tokenizes CO2 Removal Certificates bidirectionally through various bridges. This provides investment opportunities aligned with the emerging Carbon Zero mission. Given that it is a still-maturing sector with new applications, the risk profile is quite high. Toucan has tokenized 21,890,661 carbon credits to date.Steps to ImplementTo implement the project, risk analyses of the previously mentioned RWA yield strategies must be conducted. Detailed reports should be created on the risks and returns of RWA yield options categorized into three different levels: low, medium, and high risk. A public grant ($25K in ARB) should be established for this purpose, and the most competent research companies and organizations applying for the grant should be selected through on-chain voting.At the end of June, voting is underway on a recommendation by the STEP Committee to allocate $35M to low-risk assets, which are primarily composed of U.S. Treasury Bills, U.S. Government Securities, and the U.S. Dollar. This vote is currently receiving overwhelming support.If this vote is approved, $35M will be allocated to low-risk RWA products. This proposal aims to diversify the treasury by also allocating funds to medium- and high-risk RWA assets.Assuming $35M is allocated to low-risk assets, it is planned to enter a trial phase by allocating $15M to medium-risk assets and $5M to high-risk assets. If the targeted yields are successfully achieved with the allocated assets, another vote will be conducted to increase these amounts.The STEP Committee is expected to ensure the necessary organization of the program by working with relevant individuals in Legal Compliance and Partnerships. Partnerships need to be established with the providers of RWA assets identified through research. Additionally, throughout these processes, the Arbitrum Foundation and the STEP Committee should work closely together to determine whether the Arbitrum DAO can be recognized as a legal entity.TimelineMilestone 1 (Research)Share the grant program publicly on the Arbitrum Forum. Allow 2 weeks for researchers to apply to the program. Allocate 1 week for the STEP Committee to assess the qualifications of the applicants. Conduct a 1-week voting period for those who pass the qualification check. Considering potential delays, a total time frame of 5-6 weeks is required.Allow 4 weeks for the winning team to complete the research. In total, 9-10 weeks are needed.Milestone 2 (Legal Compliance)During these collaborations, depending on whether Arbitrum DAO has a legal entity or not, the Arbitrum Foundation may need to enter into some agreements.The STEP Committee will be responsible for examining the legal obligations necessary for this proposal. Since this committee is already managing the grant related to low-risk assets, they will also handle this task.Milestone 3 (Business Development and Partnership)When investing in RWA assets with Medium and High-Risk Profiles, the size of permissionless pools can be small and thus fully occupied. The Arbitrum DAO should form partnerships with intermediary projects for investing in RWA assets, enabling investments to be made directly through these partnerships.Partnership negotiations will be conducted by the STEP Committee on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO and are expected to take approximately 2-3 weeks.Milestone 4 (Medium Risk Profile Integration)Using the obtained research report, collaborate with projects that have a medium-risk profile and transfer the targeted $15M to RWA assets, sending them to the treasury’s wallet address.A time frame of 2-3 weeks is required for collaboration with two different organizations.Milestone 5 (High Risk Profile Integration)If there are no issues encountered during the diversification of the treasury with medium-risk assets, the planned $5M should also be transferred to high-risk assets.

This is different from traditional sportsbooks, where users can only take bets offered by the company running the site. This peer-to-peer model of betting leads to better odds and removes the ability of owners to exploit the users for profit.Team Members and Roles: [List team members and their roles/responsibilities]Andrew Young (Co-Founder & CEO)Julian Wilson (Co-Founder & CTO)Jake Hannah (Co-Founder & COO)Dan - Lead ArchitectLakshan - Director of EngineeringAkshar - EngineerArtem - EngineerDeclan - Business DevelopmentJay - Product ManagerJeremy - OperationsKay - MarketingKonstantin - EngineerMike - EngineerAntoine - EngineerMauricio - EngineerProject Links: [Enter Any Relevant Project Links (website, demo, github, twitter, etc.)]Twitter: https://twitter.com/SX_BetWebsite: https://sx.bet/popularDiscord: SX NetworkYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@SXNetworkContact InformationPoint of Contact (note: this should be an individual’s name, not the name of the protocol):Andrew YoungPoint of Contact’s TG handle:@youngstaxTwitter:https://twitter.com/AndrewYoung_SXEmail:andrew@nextgenbt.comDo you acknowledge that your team will be subject to a KYC requirement?:YesSECTION 2a: Team and Product InformationProvide details on your team’s past and current experience.

[Optional, but recommended]):Team has been working full-time on SX since January 2018Prior to that, founding team worked at major Canadian banks in trading and opsCEO (Andrew Young) and CTO (Julian Wilson) were trading ETFs and structured products at Bank of Montreal (BMO).COO (Jake Hannah) worked at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in operationsTotal team size is 15 people, primarily consisting of engineers.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?Our protocol’s novelty is in the utilization of a betting exchange model, as opposed to traditional betting automated market makers (AMMs) or the “house pool” model. This distinction is significant because in the traditional AMM/house pool model, economies of scale or network effects are virtually non-existent, meaning that as these platforms grow, they don’t necessarily become better or more efficient for their users.However, our betting exchange model introduces a “liquidity flywheel effect” to the Arbitrum space. This effect is a virtuous cycle, where the increasing participation of bettors on our platform incentivizes more market makers to join and provide liquidity. The presence of more liquidity on the platform leads to improved odds for bettors, making it an even more attractive destination for bettors. As more bettors are drawn to the platform due to these more attractive  odds, the cycle repeats, further enhancing the platform’s appeal through even greater liquidity and better odds. This approach not only benefits the users in terms of better odds and more liquidity but also strengthens the overall Arbitrum ecosystem by attracting more users and market makers, fostering a more vibrant and dynamic betting environment.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:SX Bet offers prediction markets on the price of crypto tokens, including $ARB. SX plans to collaborate with other protocols to launch native prediction markets on these coins, including some smaller projects.SX is also looking into integrating other currencies beyond USDC to bet with on SX Bet. SX has explored creating a universal liquidity model wherein users can bet in whichever currency they desire, but all bets are actually settled in USDC. This would entail integrating a DEX such as Camelot to facilitate atomic swap-and-bets into the model such that a user could bet with $WETH into the main $USDC liquidity pool, and on the back-end, the bettors’ $WETH is being swapped into $USDC and bet, all in the same transaction.Finally, the open interest on SX could very easily be plugged into lending platforms on Arbitrum, such as Aave or other similar platforms. Despite this being a possibility, it is not currently a priority on our roadmap.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?The most comparable products to the SX Bet on Arbitrum are Azuro, Justbet, Overtime Sports, and Betswirl; however, they offer far fewer betting markets, much lower betting limits, and less favorable odds for users. They also generate far less betting volume than SX; for context, SX is nearing $440m in total bets since inception, a multiple of all these competitors combined.How do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs)We track retention using a 30-day retention curve to see if new users that bet on Day One, are still actively betting by Day 30. We also track other metrics, such as completion of KYC, registration, creation and usage of customized promo codes, and/or creation of any affiliate links. Our product depends on the network effects generated by users, active usage of the platform is paramount. We also prioritize growing our user base by offering incentives via referrals. Lastly, we want to make sure our products are refined before adding new ones, because people definitely notice the small details - especially when betting with their hard-earned crypto.Relevant usage metrics - Please refer to the OBL relevant metrics chart 43. For your category (DEX, lending, gaming, etc) please provide a list of all respective metrics as well as all metrics in the general section:General MetricsScreenshot 2024-03-17 at 4.43.46 PM1252×968 108 KBDo you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan:YesDid you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal? If so, please disclose the details of that arrangement here, including conflicts of interest (Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant):We have a network of advisors and investors that we rely upon to offer feedback and insights when it comes to everything, including grant writing.Sandeep Nailwal, Alexander Pack, Josh Hannah, Hart Lambur, Jack Herrick, Serious People, Alex TapscottNone of these advisors will receive ANY of the incentives in this proposal, and therefore have no conflicts of interest.SECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?:No, SX Bet is deployed to our own native dApp-chain, with Arbitrum being our first cross-chain expansion. SX Bet on Arbitrum is fully cross-chain, meaning SX Bet on SX Network and SX Bet on Arbitrum work together in a seamless fashion. SX bet uses USDC liquidity to facilitate betting and open interest, to ensure we don’t need single sided deposits on every chain, fragmenting liquidity, we built SX Network to act as a liquidity hub for betting capacity. When a user bets on SX Bet on Arbitrum, the bet is relayed over atomically and placed on SX Bet on SX Network as well. This means that all bets on Arbitrum take place at the same time on both chains. This enables us to access all of our liquidity from SX Network on Arbitrum, rather than fragmenting our liquidity and having to bootstrap new liquidity on Arbitrum. This also means that bettors on Arbitrum will be getting all of the same liquidity as bettors on SX Network, but get to do so from the comfort of Arbitrum. This is also why we are spending 100% of our requested grant on growth incentives as Arbitrum users immediately have the same access to betting liquidity as users on SX.This does require the SX team to put up funds to facilitate this cross-chain relaying model. We have put $200k of USDC, split between the contract on SX Network (0x49E11807cdB710133CF760C62d2b016326CBb432) and Arbitrum (0x99Dd65a547981f662Ef8Ba0893BED966d3D78C9a) to facilitate this.On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:Currently on the SX Network app-chainSX Bet on SX Network though is primarily used by institutional bettors and market-makers due to the high friction of bridging assets to the chain and the lower trust/security of it compared to more established chains like ArbitrumSX Network is currently built on Polygon Edge. However, while the chain continues to function properly, the Edge SDK is no longer a focus of the Polygon team. SX is exploring migrating the underlying infrastructure to other infrastructure, including Arbitrum Orbit.We see SX Bet on SX Chain as being the chain used by non-crypto native professional bettors and market-makers, while SX Bet on Arbitrum will be used by mainstream crypto-native retail bettors.What date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?:November 8th, 2023Arbitrum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | ArbiscanDo you have a native token?:Yes.SX token docs: SX Token | SX NetworkSX CoinGecko page: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sx-networkPast Incentivization: What liquidity mining/incentive programs, if any, have you previously run?

Run for each of the three months.Betting Tournament: 138,000 $ARBWe plan to run our own tournament for month 1 to kickstartLeverage the ARB to run the tournament for months 2 and 3, split evenly between the two months.$SX Liquidity Mining: 60,000 $ARBBiggest liquidity mining campaign to date to make ARB the premier place to trade SX tokens.Justification for the size of the grant: [Enter explanation. More details are better, including how you arrived at the required funding for individual categories of expenses covered by your grant plan]Breaking down the three mechanics above, we can back up each section with tangible data from our existing metrics on the platform.First, the referral mechanic to attract new users on Arb. As stated we plan to run this for each of the three months, asking for a total of 300,000 $ARB.Our historical CAC has been around $155, but this has been refined on our previous chains. However, we currently live only on our own app chain - SX Network - which has big barriers to adoption, particularly for smaller bettors. This makes it likely that the CAC for SX Bet on Arbitrum will be far less as users already have assets on Arbitrum, it’s much easier to bridge to, and is more trusted. This is also in line with typical Web2 betting platforms like Fanduel and Draft kings, where new user promos range from $150 - $500.We believe that 60 ARB is a reasonable referral amount given these comps. Setting them up in a give 30 / get 30 ARB referral system. Keep in mind, all Arbitrum users will be awarding both our $1,000 USDC Welcome bonus + $20 USDC free bet bonus.With 60 ARB / user, we can leverage 100,000 ARB to conservative attract ~1,667 new users each month to SX Bet on Arbitrum.SX Bet currently has a ~25% retention rate on new users after 1-month, so our goal will be to retain ~416 users at the end of each month.If we run the referral campaign for 12 weeks we should be able to attract +5,000 new bettors, with a goal of retaining close to 1,250 of those users at the end of the program. This would align with our current MAU’s we are seeing on other chains.Second, we have the tournaments in month 2 and 3 of the overall campaign, seeking 138,000 $ARB split evenly between those two months focused on increasing betting volume.It’s worth noting - we already have announced our own tournament for month 1 to help kickstart things! We have $69,420 of prizes ready for this pool!Regarding volume, our goal would be to work towards 15M in total monthly bets at the end of month 3. We plan to do this through two month long tournaments, starting in month 2 and 3 of LTIPP.Historically, for every $1 of incentives, we have been able to produce $50 in betting volume. We think it’s reasonable to assume on a new chain we can double this and achieve similar results. So for every $1 of incentives we can produce $100 of volume.We plan to run two tournaments, one each for month 2 and 3 of LTIPP. The focus will be to retain the users coming from the referral campaigns.With 69,000 ARB, at $1 incentives / $100 bets we can target to incentivize a minimum of roughly $7,000,000 of bet volume on Arbitrum in month two.We then can follow that up with another 69,000 ARB, with similar metrics again targeting a goal of roughly $7,000,000 of bet volume in month three.We also plan to remove 100% of our barrier to entry by removing our fee for at least the first three months so we can increase the likelihood of successfully hitting these metrics on Arbirum. We believe that this is a great way to show goodwill to Arbitrum and its users on SX bet’s dime.Lastly, we plan to give SX rewards so we would like to kickstart liquidity on Arbitrum for our token. We figured a simple liquidity mining campaign over the 90 days distributing 60,000 ARB, 20k each month will do the trick.Looking at current incentives for the SX token, we can pull live data from the SharkSwap farm we have. We are seeing 17% ‘TVL / Incentives APR’ on that farm. If we take the 60,000 ARB and spread it evenly across the 90 days we would have roughly $40,000 of incentives each month for SX/WETH liquidity on Arbitrum. $40k/17% give us roughly $2.8M of liquidity over those 90 days. With the fluctuation of ARB targeting $2M as a goal here should be reasonable. For a $55M MCAP token that is an adequate amount of liquidity.Grant Matching:We have lowered our fees to 0% to decrease the barrier to entry to our platform during this campaign!We also are airdropping $1,000,000 of free bets to 10,000 users on Arbitrum this week. We specifically are targeting wallets that have used a web3 betting apps in the past.Additionally we already have announced our own tournament for month 1 to help kickstart things. We have already announced that we are giving away $69,420 USDC of prizes for the first tournament, irrespective of this grant. All Arbitrum users will also be eligible for the standard $1,000 USDC Welcome Bonus and $20 USDC free, which means SX will be spending up to an additional $6,000,000+ USDC in bonuses for new Arbitrum users across all these initiatives.Grant Breakdown: [Please provide a high-level overview of the budget breakdown and planned use of funds]We want to apply three incentive mechanics:Referral Mechanic: 300,000 $ARB - 100,000 each monthBetting Tournament: 138,000 $ARB - 69,000 for tournaments in month 2 and 3$SX Liquidity Mining: 60,000 $ARB - 20,000 each monthFunding Address: [Enter the specific address where funds will be sent for grant recipients]0x654AE05b5f3917DC56F0De2AA66Ae00479d42c43Funding Address Characteristics:Will be ⅔ multisigTreasury Address: [Please list out ALL DAO wallets that hold ANY DAO funds]0xc47f72D3fa9477847e95BbA37A1a55D9Ccd44988Contract Address: [Enter any specific address that will be used to disburse funds for grant recipients]We will deploy it before receiving any streamed grant funds, but waiting to see if the grant is approved and for how much before deploying.SECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESClearly outline the primary objectives of the program and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), execution strategy, and milestones used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the program aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.Objectives:Increase User Base: Utilize the referral campaign as a mechanism to significantly grow the user base by incentivizing both new and existing users.Enhance User Engagement: Encourage active participation and engagement on the platform through the mutual benefit of referral bonuses.Increase bet volume: Leverage the tournaments to bootstrap bet volume on Arbitrum, encouraging participation in the various bet markets we have available.Boost Platform Testing: Leverage the increased traffic from new users to gather valuable feedback and insights, helping to refine and improve the platform’s offerings.Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including token distribution method (e.g. farming, staking, bonds, referral program, etc), what you are incentivizing, resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]Referral Program: Allocate 300,000 ARB for a referral initiative, rewarding new users with a give 30 / get 30 ARB bonus. We already have both an affiliate program (with 74 affiliates signed up) and promo codes set-up on SX, which have already been working really well with proper link tracking and attribution. See below for the New User registration on SX for an example:1250×1186 111 KBWe plan to have an available referral pool of 100,000 ARB each month. In order to qualify for the bonus and be eligible to give out their own referral codes, users will need to fully KYC to do so. We already require KYC to utilize the platform, so we naturally have a mechanic baked in to ensure users cannot easily farm this referral system. This is the only reason this type of referral system can work without being gamed as if we didn’t have the KYC, then this type of referral system would be incredibly easy to abuse and sybilled very easily. We utilize Jumio for our KYC, which requires users to submit an ID and requires a liveness check (i.e. a selfie):1600×970 69.8 KBThis mechanism makes our referral and affiliate system far more bullet-proof than the majority of on-chain referral systems. With 300,000 ARB allocated to this, this promo should drive a minimum of 5,000 new, fully-KYCed users to SX Bet on Arbitrum.Betting Tournaments: We will use another 138,000 ARB to host two massive betting tournaments, incentivizing competitive participation with ARB token prizes.We already run betting tournaments on a regular basis so we have all the infrastructure to track and reward users. As we noted we are running our own $69,420 USDC tournament for our Arbitrum launch to help kickstart things. Our current Arbitrum tournament already has 456 people signed up for it before it’s even begun:1600×631 118 KBYou can see a breakdown of the tournament here - we plan to run a similar kind of tournament in months 2 and 3 with the ARB rewards. As you can see we already have everything ready and have been promoting the tournament and our expansion to Arbitrum already!SX Liquidity Mining: Incentivizing a new SX/WETH pairing on Arbitrum. We plan to collaborate with one of the leading DEX’s to distribute these rewards, likely Camelot or Sushiswap. Both have the infrastructure to offer incentives and a liquidity mining campaign like this is pretty vanilla. Rewards will be claimable on a rolling basis, standard for a program like this with users will receive their proportional rewards based on their liquidity / total liquidity in the pool.Risk Management:Abuse Prevention: We have a new user verification process already set-up to authenticate identity of new users and prevent multiple accounts from the same individual from being used, utilizing the KYC system by Jumio.Tournament Integrity: Establish clear rules and monitoring systems for betting tournaments to prevent any form of manipulation or unfair advantage, preserving the integrity of competitions. We have this infrastructure in place as we run a lot of betting tournaments as is.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric? [Provide relevant design and implementation details]In an effort to align with Arbitrum growth metrics, SX Bet will be launching on Arbitrum with a 0% take rate fee to encourage new betting! We will keep this 0% fee for the duration of the Arbitrum Incentives, potentially longer, to keep users on the platform and increase the stickiness of everything we are doing.Additionally, we feel the following also helps with stickiness:Competitive Engagement: We will continue to host a series of betting tournaments with our own token prizes encouraging active and continuous participation. The competitive nature of tournaments, coupled with tangible rewards, increases user engagement and encourages repeat participation.Diverse Participation: Catering to different user segments, from casual bettors to more competitive ones, ensures a broader appeal, increasing the likelihood of participants finding value and continuing to engage with the platform.Continuous Improvement Feedback Loop: Utilizing increased platform activity to gather user feedback for continuous improvement of platform features and user experience. This direct involvement in the platform’s development process increases user investment and loyalty.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy. [Please also justify why these specific KPIs will indicate that the grant has met its objective. Distribution of the grant itself should not be one of the KPIs.]Looking at current performance indicators, we have the following data on the SX Bet platform:We currently have ~228.6 WAU (Past 12 wks)We currently are seeing about 4000 tx / dayWe were generating ~$100,000 in revenue / month, prior to cutting our fee to 0%.We historically have a 2% take rate on profits. (We will be starting with 0% on ARB)We currently generate roughly $13m Monthly betting volume, a multiple of the next highest web3 sports betting dapp.Our goals are as follows:Users: Gain +5,000 new users via the referral campaign, retaining a minimum of 25% of those to ultimately get 1,250 active users at the end of the program.Cumulative Bet Volume: Specifically with the ARB we are targeting $40,000,000 of cumulative bet volume by the end of the program. Please note, we did make our milestones higher given we are putting our own money up for the first month’s tournament which should give us a boost on hitting the overall milestones!$SX Liquidity: $2M of liquidity over the 90 days. Our math above shows a slightly higher number, we wanted to be a bit more conservative here given ARB price fluctuation and this being a new chain.Grant Timeline and Milestones: [Describe the timeline for the grant, including ideal milestones with respective KPIs. Include at least one milestone that shows progress en route to a final outcome. Please justify the feasibility of these milestones.]Milestone 1 - Weeks 1-4: Launch and Initial User OnboardingObjective: The goal is to bring on 1,667 new users to engage with the platform using 100,000 ARB tokens for referral rewards and keep them engaged with both the $69,420 USDC tournament already scheduled and paid for.ARB Needed: 100,000 ARB for referral campaign20,000 ARB for liquidity mining= 120,000 ARB totalActivities:Deploy referral program to attract new users.Deploy traditional liquidity mining farm.Set up onboarding process that includes educational resources about Arbitrum and how to use SX betDistribute incentives to users who sign up and meet predefined activity criteria.SX to run first Arbitrum Betting Tournament using $69,420 of prizes from SX BetExpected Outcome: Reach a betting volume of $5 million by the end of Month 1 ($167,667/day). This would instantly make the SX Bet on Arbitrum the largest GambleFi Dapp on Arbitrum or any Ethereum layer 2.Milestone 2 - Weeks 5-8: Expansion and Sustained GrowthObjective: Build on the initial momentum to incentivize additional users, aiming for cumulative adoption of 5,000 users by the end of this period.ARB Needed: 100,000 ARB for referral campaign20,000 ARB for liquidity mining69,000 ARB for betting tournament= 189,000 ARB totalActivities:Analyze data from the first phase to refine the referral program if needed.Kickstart the first Arbitrum $ARB incentivised tournament.Continue educational outreach to improve user engagement and retention.Expected Outcome:Increase cumulative betting volume to $15 million by the end of Month 2. At this level of volume, SX Bet on Arbitrum would rival SX Bet on SX Chain as the largest GambleFi dapp in the world by betting volume. It would likely far surpass SX Bet on SX Chain by number of users, as SX Bet on SX Chain is mostly used by institutional bettors and market-makers, whereas SX Bet on Arbitrum will be mostly used by retail bettors.Milestone 3 - Weeks 9-12: Consolidation and ScalingObjective: Solidify user base and push for higher engagement levels, targeting a total of 10,000 engaged users.ARB Needed: 100,000 ARB for referral campaign20,000 ARB for liquidity mining69,000 ARB for betting tournament= 189,000 ARB totalActivities:Analyze data from milestone 2 and adjust the referral program if neededKickstart the second Arbitrum tournamentContinue educational outreach to improve user engagement and retention.Expected Outcome: Reach a final cumulative betting volume of $30 million by the end of Month 3.How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem? [Clearly explain how the inputs of your program justify the expected benefits to the DAO. Be very clear and tangible, and you must back up your claims with data]With more volume and users than any of the other betting platforms on Arbitrum, we believe that the 498,000 ARB will be a great investment for the DAO. We plan to migrate as many users and volume to Arbitrum as possible, this grant will make the conversion process much easier. We believe that this product fits perfectly into the Arbitrum ecosystem, filling a much needed gap and replicating the success that we’ve been able to achieve on SX Network. Our goal is to make Arbitrum the premier chain for crypto-native retail bettors.We believe we have strong backing to our ask, using tangible data from our ecosystem and validating further with web2 comparables. We also are bringing a lot to the table to support this migration, including removing fees, doing our own tournament for month 1 (with more to come after the ARB ones), bootstrapping $SX liquidity on Arbitrum, and spending heavily on our own marketing campaigns.All that plus this grant should give us a huge boost as we come onto the stage. We are also very excited as this is our first cross chain move away from our native dapp chain, making Aribtrum our first real home. We want to thank you for the opportunity to apply for support and making all this possible!In summary:We plan to use 300,000 ARB for referral mechanics, with a goal to attract a minimum of 5,000 new bettors.We plan to use 138,000 ARB for tournaments, with the goal to increase bet volume to a cumulative total of $15,000,000 by the end of the 12 weeks.Between both mechanics, our goal is to have a 25% retention rate, keeping 1,250 users post program.60,000 ARB over 90 days for traditional liquidity mining to establish Arbitrum as the primary trading venue for $SX with the deepest trading pool and only WETH pair available exclusively on Arbitrum.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?YesSECTION 5: Data and ReportingOpenBlock Labs has developed a comprehensive data and reporting checklist for tracking essential metrics across participating protocols.

Any details relating to past projects, recent achievements and any past experience utilizing incentives. Additionally, please provide further details on the state of your product, audience segments, and how you expect incentives to impact the product’s long-term growth and sustainability.Team experience (Any relevant experience that may be useful in evaluating ability to ship, or execution with grant incentives. Please provide references knowledgeable about past work, where relevant. If you wish to do so privately, indicate that. [Optional, but recommended]):Revest is led by a team with experience spanning Apple, Centrifuge, Mckinsey & Citi.Revest is one of the first protocols to utilize NFTs as financial positions. Recognizing the oncoming explosion of the tokenization of everything, we deployed the Revest Protocol on ETH Mainnet in 2021 with a focus on turning vested tokens into tokenized FNFTs to allow for more secure locking / automated unlocks for vested positions.We realized that there were even deeper use cases for the FNFT technology, and turned our attention to Interest Rate Swaps in March of 2022. We launched the Resonate protocol in October of 2022 on Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Fantom, and ETH Mainnet. From October 2022 - February 2023 we focused on high yielding, volatile yield farms such as GLP - allowing users a way to hedge against interest rate fluctuations & realize their yield today - we were able to achieve 5.66M in cumulative volume during that time. After months in the market, we made a decision to shift our focus to the US Treasury RWAs that were starting to flow on chain.We spent the better part of 2023 performing market research, developing key relationships & partnerships with all of the major Tokenizers in the space (Open Eden, OpenTrade, Centrifuge for example) and with various participants in other industries to explore pilots & use cases involving players in industries like Trucking Logistics, and Insurance.We are happy to have over $50 million in capital commitments from various partners to deploy into Resonate. The next phase is finding a long term home for scaling our products & of course our first thoughts were to continue to build on Arbitrum!What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?For users, we bring the novel concept of principle protection on their fixed income assets while they hold them on chain. For Abritrum, we bring sticky liquidity & utility for RWAs that find a home on Arbitrum.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:Yes, in a few ways:Resonate will integrate with Open Eden’s TBILL product so that users can bring TBILL to Resonate pools for yield swap utility.The Resonate FNFTs that users receive are fully transferable ERC1155s that can be sold on secondary NFT marketplaces on Arbiturm. We are also seeking integrations with money markets & NFTFI lending platforms to provide additional utility to holders of Resonate FNFTs.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?Pendle is another player within the sub sector of Interest Rate Swaps - however we provide very different products and are targeting very different asset classes currently. Pendle utilizes ERC20 tokens and a VAMM model to fuel the interest rate trading and LPing on chain.We chose an orderbook model to facilitate the trades along with ERC1155 NFTs to represent the principle and interest positions within the trades, which allows for 0 slippage execution. On Resonate, users not only get a fixed rate, they also get their yield payment immediately vs having to wait until maturity in the Pendle model.How do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs):One of the novel parts about Resonate that is perfect for Grants is that users MUST make a tradeoff in order to realize any rewards. When a user get’s their up front yield payment, the assets are locked via smart contract into the Blockchain - this allows us to much better ensure an ROI to the Arbitrum DAO as a result of any dollars of ARB spent on Resonate.The primary KPIs that we target that indicate success for our products are Notional Volume, TVL.For additional stickiness, we will be implementing a lock bonus.Bonus APR on higher locking time → Users set a lock for a higher time → increase of user and TVL retention + alignment with long-term holders.Relevant usage metrics - Please refer to the OBL relevant metrics chart 22. For your category (DEX, lending, gaming, etc) please provide a list of all respective metrics as well as all metrics in the general section:General Metrics: Daily Active Users, Daily User Growth, Daily Transaction Count, Daily Transaction Fee, Daily ARB Expenditure and User Claims, Incentivized User List & GinRelevant Metrics: TVL, Borrowed Amount, Daily Borrowing Volume, Daily Deposits Volume, List of Depositors, List of Borrowers, Loan Origination Volume,Do you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan: [Yes/No]: YES.Did you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal? If so, please disclose the details of that arrangement here, including conflicts of interest (Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant): NO.SECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?: [Yes/No, and provide explanation] Resonate, our yield futures protocol, is cross chain. We are looking for the best home for our efforts surrounding the expansion of RWAs on chain, and we view Arbiturm as the ideal candidate with tokenized RWAs currently present, like Open Eden, and upcoming launches for projects like Ondo, and Centrifuge.On what other networks is the protocol deployed?: Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, Polygon, Fantom.What date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?: [Date + transaction ID. If not yet live on mainnet, explain why.] 0x2782ef34c5d9d276f070b910172ed7217ede6873ee5fcc6679d63cfd6ea3c449 Sep-30-2022 01:49:15 AM +UTCDo you have a native token?: Yes. https://docs.revest.finance/rvst-token/tokenomics-and-distribution.Past Incentivization: What liquidity mining/incentive programs, if any, have you previously run? Please share results and dashboards, as applicable? None. This will be our first program.Current Incentivization: How are you currently incentivizing your protocol? We are currently not incentivizing the protocol with token emissions, we have been focused on organic growth through the utility that we provide to RWA tokenizers & relevant clients.Have you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem related program? - No.Protocol Performance: [Detail the past performance of the protocol and relevance, including any key metrics or achievements, dashboards, etc.]Since launch in October 2022 we have been proud to collaborate with several Arbitrum protocols as we scaled our MVP- including GMX, Umami, and Gains Network.Resonate has achieved ~5.66 million USD in volume. Since Resonate’s mechanism is modeled after traditional order books, we believe volume is the most indicative metric for our project as TVL fluctuates based on the targeted maturities of the trades in question. Current TVL sits at over $1.02 million USD per DefiLlama.1600×802 428 KBProtocol Roadmap: [Describe relevant roadmap details for your protocol or relevant products to your grant application. Include tangible milestones over the next 12 months.]Roadmap Milestones:Q2 2024: Deployment of Resonate Contracts to Kinto / Scaled launch of Redux AI trading vault on Arbiturm. ARB token deployments to depositors on Resonate (on Kinto and Arbitrum) & Redux (on Arbitrum).Q2 - Q3 2024 - Achieve an accumulative 20M TVL through Revest products on Arbitrum & Kinto.Q4 2024 - Q1 2025 - Scale the onboarding of Revest clients from Tradfi into Arbitrum.Audit History & Security Vendors:Audits: Security and Audits | ResonateBug Bounty: Bug Bounty | ResonateSecurity Incidents:Prior to launching Resonate in October of 2022, the Revest Protocol was exploited in March 2022 in a relatively sophisticated exploit of a bug in the solidity code that went unfound by our team, auditors, and peer reviews. Full details can be found here: Revest Protocol Exploit Recovery Plan.Following the exploit, Revest protocol developers implemented a fix for the vulnerability in the code and underwent (2) additional security audits with Zellic and Blocksec to ensure security was restored. Full details can be found here: Revest Finance Announces Blocksec & Zellic Audits. We would later use these same (2) firms to audit the Resonate Platform as well, due to our overwhelmingly positive experience with these firms.As a result of the exploit, we created a first of its kind security architecture that would ensure any further issues were isolated to the fullest extent of technology. We termed the methodology “Sand Boxed Counterfactual Storage” which essentially means that all deposits into Revest technology are completely siloed from one another - so if a hacker does somehow get access to an FNFT, there is no way to take control of other FNFTs and subsequent deposits in those contracts. More details can be found here: Revest implements Sandbox Counterfactual StorageSECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONDetail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.Requested Grant Size: 75,000 ARB.Justification for the size of the grant 23: [Enter explanation. More details are better, including how you arrived at the required funding for individual categories of expenses covered by your grant plan]RWA tvl has grown to over $1 billion in recent months on chain, with no clear winner amongst the competing Ethereum L2s or ALT L1s - which presents a unique opportunity for chains to exert their influence on where permissioned RWA’s find their ultimate home on chain.Resonate is in a unique position to spur this growth. We believe the on chain economy is the best place for RWA’s to live due to the greatest benefit Defi can offer: composability. Through Resonate’s compsable nature, we can provide utility to RWAs (starting with US Treasuries) that will serve as a catalyst for growth on Arbitrum.Resonate is also uniquely positioned to be able to incentivize an outsized amount of TVL with the ARB provided due our orderbook model and the fact that the lenders only pay the borrower based on the earning power of the assets in question. For example, to incentivize a 1 month T Bill position of $1,0000 USD - you only need $4 of capital on Resonate to incentivize a deposit (4.75% pay out on 5% earning power, annualized), and so its extremely capital efficient.We have reviewed current STIP recipients, and have determined the amount of ARB requested in our grant based on those results, but also based on the calculations you will see herein (section 4 specifically).We have crafted our proposal with the current budget, and oversubscription in mind.Grant Matching: NA.Grant Breakdown:Any granted ARB will be used to incentivize deposits for the following product lines on Arbitrum during the 12-week incentive period.Resonate Finance - TBILL (OPEN EDEN) Pools. 75,000 ARB.ProductsWeekly DistributionTotal DistributionResonate FinanceTBILL (OPEN EDEN) Pools6,250 ARB per week for the duration of the 12 weeks75,000 ARB**Funding Address:**0x397002E9E957990fe39E84FD55095f998a953e81Funding Address Characteristics: ⅗ Gnosis MultisigTreasury Address:0xaF84f7D4061df1AaFbbec39DE7726D4F80beb6520x397002E9E957990fe39E84FD55095f998a953e810x0c6c8f014d1B3E37F470d39356379E220e4Beb67Contract Address: Not applicable, currently in-devSECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESClearly outline the primary objectives of the program and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), execution strategy, and milestones used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the program aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.Utilizing the distribution schedule above, and the execution strategy below, we seek to provide a meaningful reason for the TBILL token to continue to grow on Arbitrum while providing a signal to traditional market participants that their assets should live on chain (on Arbitrum).Objectives:The primary objectives with the use of any granted tokens would be to proliferate sticky liquidity within the product lines that Revest Labs has deployed to Arbitrum.Signaling to the market that Arbitrum is the home of RWA innovation.Revest Labs has been working closely with the team from Open Eden, with the synergistic goal of driving treasury yields to Arbitrum. OpenEden Labs’ mission is to bring real-world assets to DeFi to unlock trillions of dollars in value. Resonate can provide innovative utility to holders of Open Eden’s TBILL token, which is now live on Arbitrum.Through the use of the granted ARB, TBILL holders will be able to deposit their tokens into Resonates smart contracts, and receive an up front, fixed rate yield payment on their assets from one of our lenders + ARB incentives that outperforms the risk free rate. The TBILL liquidity is then locked for a set duration (offerings will be 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days). Now, the TBILL user can go deploy that yield into higher risk strategies on Arbitrum.The benefits to Arbitrum are three fold.Total Value Locked is actually locked. Any deposits of TBILL into Resonate are locked for the duration, and cannot be pulled from the smart contracts. This provides a sticky mechanism for liquidity on Arbitrum.Capital remains incredibly efficient - the same amount of capital that is already sitting in TBILL on Arbitrum could flow into Resonate, which will increase the amount of TVL on arbitrum with the same liquidity based on the way TVL is calculated today.Arbitrum signals to other market participants that are building in the RWA space, or traditional institutions that are seeking to experiment within on chain finance, that Arbiturm is the home for RWA innovation within the industry.Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including token distribution method (e.g. farming, staking, bonds, referral program, etc), what you are incentivizing, resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]100% of the granted ARB tokens towards Resonate RWA contracts - incentivizing users to lock their liquidity into the fixed rate borrowing side of Resonate - they will receive any deposited loans from the Lending side of the Resonate system + ARB incentives. Boosted APR will be provided in ARB tokens for longer duration locks within Resonate pools.Assuming a 5% yield on US Treasury, the borrower would receive 4.75% upfront from the lender. Revest Labs would, then, increase the upfront yield by providing a time weighted boost to the percentage, depending on the tranche selected.This table below depicts how we will utilize 75,000 arb at the avg price of ARB over the previous rolling 30 day period ($1.98) to incentivize $15,000,000 in volume on 1 month and 30,000,00 on 3 month deposit.image691×703 32.3 KBWe view the $45M goal as achievable due to interest expressed by Revest’s current pipeline, in addition to exploratory BD efforts with Revest’s tokenization partners.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric? [Provide relevant design and implementation details]Resonate contracts inherently require users to lock their liquidity for a set duration in order to be able to attain an up front payment of the yield from their RWA assets.The two offered durations to coincide with this program are 1 month, and 3 month locked maturities.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy. [Please also justify why these specific KPIs will indicate that the grant has met its objective. Distribution of the grant itself should not be one of the KPIs.]Borrowing Volume: This will showcase the total upfront yield distributed to borrowers through Resonate; one of the core value propositions of Resonate.Deposit Volume: This will represent the amount of capital on Resonate willing to be matched. It will show the interest in tranche usage, and can be used to see demand for each side of the poolTrading Volume: On Resonate, this will represent the total USD actually matched through our temporal order book mechanism. This would be the most indicative metric for achieving our grant objectives.TVL: Value (in USD) locked through Resonate into FNFTsAll of these values can be sourced and verified through data available on-chain and on block explorers.Grant Timeline and Milestones: [Describe the timeline for the grant, including ideal milestones with respective KPIs. Include at least one milestone that shows progress en route to a final outcome. Please justify the feasibility of these milestones.]Grant approval & distribution (Approval)Incentives go live on Resonate (Approval + 2 weeks).Achieve $20 million in volume (Approval + 6 weeks) to indicate that the goal of $20 million is achievable.Achieve $45 million in volume (approval + 12 weeks).How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem? [Clearly explain how the inputs of your program justify the expected benefits to the DAO. Be very clear and tangible, and you must back up your claims with data]This grant will allow us to help further establish Arbitrum as the home for RWA tokenization innovation within the industry. Furthermore, any ARB granted to Resonate will create network effects for the tokenization partners deployed to Arbiturm that integrate with Resonate, through the utility that we provide their tokens in the marketplace.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream? [Yes/No] YES.SECTION 5: Data and ReportingOpenBlock Labs has developed a comprehensive data and reporting checklist for tracking essential metrics across participating protocols. Teams must adhere to the specifications outlined in the provided link here: Onboarding Checklist from OBL 19.

YesSECTION 2a: Team and Product InformationTeam experienceThe Sperax team has extensive experience in developing and managing on-chain products. The team has shipped out multiple products on Arbitrum. The team has been running the Spreax ecosystem protocols since its inception in 2020. We have recently launched an upgraded and audited version of the USDs protocol. The USDs code-base is publicly available and open for integration with other protocols. We are soon going to launch Demeter version 2 with improved user experience and functionality.Sperax ecosystem has a TVL of over $5M and Demeter has a TVL of about $1.5M. Currently, the ecosystem tokens (i.e. USDs and SPA) have been held by over 300K on-chain wallets and have registered about 1.2 million on-chain arbitrum transactions. The ecosystem has generated a revenue of over $500K.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?USDsUSDs is a fully collateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain collateral and generates organic yield for its holders. It auto-compounds and provides gasless and stable rewards to its holders. We want to make USDs a premier trading pair on Arbitrum.USDs automates the process of earning yield on stablecoins. Yield is generated organically by sending collateral to audited decentralized finance protocols. 50% of yield generated on collateral is used to pay USDs holders Auto-Yield. USD auto-yield rate is adjustable and depends on the actual yield generated by the collaterals. Any yield generated beyond the max Auto-yield rate will be stored in Auto-yield reserves. This novel passive income strategy does not require any action from the user. Users can just hold USDs and see their wallet balance grow, auto-compounding the yield in the process.1600×957 148 KBCurrently, the protocol is accepting USDC.e, USDC, USDC.e, Frax, DAI, USDT, and LUSD as collateral and more tokens might be added to this list in the future. However, USDs tokens are fungible and redeemable in the same way, independent of their underlying minting collateral. It acts as an IOU on the pooled collateral.A list of yield strategies and the amount of collateral allocated is displayed on the Analytics page of Sperax USD dApp and this data is readily available to the public by querying the smart contracts. Currently deployed strategies are mentioned below.USDC: Compound & AaveUSDC.e: Compound & AaveDAI: AaveUSDT: Aave & StargateFRAX: StargateLUSD: AaveKey parameters upgradeable via governanceCollateral types to mint/ redeem USDs.Desired collateral composition, oracle used for price feed of the collateral, base Mint Fee, base Redemption Fee, and price floor for each collateral type. Updating the price floor for collateral usedto mint USDs. Setting the price floors for each collateral will allow the protocol to remain solvent when collaterals depeg. The protocol will not mint USDs with the collateral when the price of the collateral falls below the price floor.Yield generation strategies for each collateral type. For example, adding new delta-neutral yield farming strategies based on other decentralized exchanges.Harvesting incentive.The USDs dripping rate from the dripper contract.Minimum and maximum APR for distribution of Auto-Yield.Key functions available to the publicHarvesting or claiming all kinds of yield tokens from the yield generation strategies.

We will use the respective oracles for the yield tokens to determine the market price. This experience will be similar to the currently implemented buyback contract.Distributing the auto-yield to all addresses eligible to collect it. Rebase will also be triggered when someone Mints or Redeems.1050×887 64.8 KBUSDs Data since the launch of version 2.0 (15th January 2024)1600×825 165 KBApart from that USDs aims to become one of the top liquidity provider tokens for perpetual exchanges. Perp protocols find it difficult to attract liquidity providers without heavily incentivizing it with their governance tokens. USDs could solve that problem through its organic auto-yield.DemeterDemeter protocol is a protocol for DAOs to launch and manage decentralized exchange liquidity - without needing to know how to code. Demeter gives users the power to launch incentivized liquidity pools on Uniswap V3 and Camelot V2. Future versions will support custom liquidity shapes on major DEXs such as Balancer, Sushiswap, or anything veSPA holders prefer. Demeter is launched on Arbitrum and will soon be expanded to Optimism, Polygon, and Ethereum. Additional blockchains will be added in future versions.How Does Demeter Work1600×900 110 KBDemeter Architecture936×426 50.9 KBWe will keep upgrading the Demeter platform to improve user experience and ease of usage. The first step in that direction will be the introduction of the Zapp feature to directly create an LP position with one token.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:Our projects are composable with other projects on Arbitrum.The USDs protocol is open for integration with other protocols that want to utilize the benefit of auto-yield and share the rewards with their user. The contracts are public and available on our GitHub.Demeter Protocol is a permissionless protocol. Any project interested in incentivizing concentrated liquidity on Arbitrum can launch their farms using Demeter. With Demeter 2.0, the protocol will be open for integration with Dexes looking for solutions to provide liquidity farming for their partners.If you have any integrations, please mention them and explain how they have improved outcomes for both projects. Support this with data.With regards to USDs, after the launch of upgraded version 2.0, the USDs TVL has increased by 25%. USDs takes USDC, USDC.e, USDT, DAI, FRAX, and LUSD as collateral. The collateral is directly deposited in Aave, Compound, and Stargate. Since the launch of version 2, USDs has accrued over $75,000 in yield from strategies with about $5000 available in the yield reserves. We will soon propose on the forum to directly transfer all the yield generated from strategies to the holders, instead of a cap of 10%.Currently, the demeter protocol is active with about 1.5 M in TVL. The Camelot integration, which was the last DEX integration, helped the protocol to get about 650K in liquidity. With the launch of Demeter 2.0, it will be integrated with Camelot V3 and the contracts will be made publicly available to facilitate integrations with other Dexes.How do you measure and think about retention internally?All USDs analytics data is available publicly here. For both, USDs and Demeter, TVL is the basis of measuring the retention. For USDs, our objective is to provide an APR of 10% to all liquid holders. On Demeter, we have emitted close to 100M SPA tokens to bring in new farms and LPs and retain them.After the launch of USDs 2.0 and the subsequent launch of Demeter 2.0, we are targeting a USDs TVL of $10 Mn and a Demeter TVL of $20 Mn in 12 weeks.Do you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan?YesDid you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal?

Key highlights include:USDs Enhancements: Expanding USDs reach through strategic partnerships, real-world integrations, and an airdrop for holders.CDP Stablecoin: A new stablecoin leveraging USDs and offering potential one-click leverage for users.Demeter 2.0: Upgrading Sperax’s liquidity farming platform with multi-chain, multi-DEX functionality and concentrated liquidity pools.Decentralized Future: A revamped Sperax dApp with open-sourced code and a completely decentralized USDs protocol governed by the community.Multi-Chain Expansion: USDs venturing into various blockchain ecosystems for wider user access and liquidity.This roadmap positions Sperax as a leader in shaping a more accessible and user-centric DeFi future.The complete roadmap for 2024 is available here.Audit History & Security Vendors:All the audit reports of the protocol are publicly available on our GitHub account. The USDs protocol recently got audited in December 2023 by the Quantstamp team. We have launched our bug bounty program for USDs smart contracts. The Demeter contract will go for audits in 3rd week of March. It will be included in the bounty program post-Demeter 2.0 launch.Security Incidents:We had a security incident in February 2023. All funds were recovered and we went back live again within 3 days. All details about the incident are available here.Could you briefly detail the incident, the amount stolen, and any recoveries?On Feb 3, an attacker manipulated the USDs balance on a multi-sig wallet and changed it to 9.7 billion by exploiting an internal bug in the USDs token contract. Before the Sperax team paused the contract, the attacker exchanged ~309k USDs for assets including USDT, USDC, and WETH.The Sperax team coordinated with the attacker and recovered all the funds.SECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONRequested Grant Size:250,500 ARBsJustification for the size of the grant:The ARB grant will be used to boost the TVL for Demeter and USDs. The ARB tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers on Demeter farms with USDs or SPA at a steady APR. Using Demeter, any protocol would be able to create deep liquidity for their token in a permissionless manner. More details on how the steady APR farms will work can be found here.Our target is to start the incentivization plan with the launch of Demeter 2.0 after the end of the current STIP emissions.We are targetingUSDs TVL of $10Mn,Demeter TVL of $20MnUSDs TVL and Demeter TVL are interrelated as USDs liquidity on Demeter will be incentivized with ARB tokens.Grant Matching:We will match the emissions of ARB tokens in USD terms for emissions to USDs and SPA-based liquidity farms. For every 1 USD worth of ARB used to incentivise a USDs farm, we will emit 1 USD worth of SPA tokens in the form of xSPA. One-third of the xSPA tokens will be distributed as additional rewards for providing locked liquidity.Grant Breakdown:All ARB tokens will be emitted through Demeter. We plan to achieve the target TVL of $20Mn through Demeter in 12 weeks. The target is divided into 3 cycles. The details regarding the TVL targets and emission plans for each cycle are mentioned below. The emissions are projected based on the current prices of the tokens and may change in the future.MonthTarget TVL (USD)SPA rewardsArb RewardsRewards in SPA tokens ($0.02)Extra Rewards in ARB tokens ($2)13,750,000600006000030000003000029,000,000136000136000680000068000320,000,00030500030500015250000152500Funding Address: arb1:0x8898A38Eb8E3104f7c98622b55260E014B3a0217Funding Address Characteristics: It’s a 2/4 multisig.Treasury Address: Treasury addresses and their SPA holdingsTreasuryStakingArbitrum0x3702E3e2DB2b5d037c1dbB23Ab7A51d0Cc90BD0e481,082,245TreasuryTreasuryArbitrum0xBA6ca0B9e7333f5e667816b85704c024AB250C9D1,250,000,000TreasuryBootstrapEthereum0x8B65CE3b4Eaa8958346096C3a9303b73f2012aCc7,027,923TreasuryBootstrapArbitrum0xAF64e027D42bAc1C14277fd295De9Ae318eEF17E72,083,332TreasuryRewarderArbitrum0x432c3BcdF5E26Ec010dF9C1ddf8603bbe261c1883,258,568TreasuryveSPA rewarderArbitrum0xC9869e40e36A18546Df54A941B28aF21674aE5121,107,327Contract Address: 0xAF64e027D42bAc1C14277fd295De9Ae318eEF17ESECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESClearly outline the primary objectives of the program and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), execution strategy, and milestones used to measure success.

This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]Permissionless distribution of tokens through Demeter rewarder contracts. Tokens will be distributed at a steady rate based on the underlying token’s TVL.Initially, the pools, set on Camelot v3, will be incentivized via Demeter by the Sperax team with ARB tokens.APR will initially be set to 25% in ARB and 25% SPA for the following farmsUSDC/USDsUSDC.e/USDsUSDT/USDsETH/USDsARB/USDswBTC/USDsSPA/USDs*As the TVL of the farm increases, the APR will be adjusted in the following manner.Min Farm TVLMax Farm TVLARB APRxSPA APR01,000,00025%25%1,000,0002,000,00022.5%22.5%2,000,0003,000,00020%20%3,000,0004,000,00017.5%17.5%4,000,0005,000,00015.0%15.0%*The SPA/USDs will be will get three times the emissions in SPA as stated in the table above.Initially, the pools, set on Camelot v3, will be incentivized via Demeter by the Sperax team with ARB tokens.A protocol interested in incentivizing their tokens would be able to launch a farm on Demeter in a permissionless manner and request an ARB emission on Sperax governance via the forum.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity, or some other targeted metric? [Provide relevant design and implementation details]Users will be incentivized to lock their liquidity. One-third of xSPA emissions mentioned in the execution strategy will be for locked liquidity.Greater liquidity for USDs can help the USDs token acquire a Chainlink oracle which will make it suitable as an asset for various perpetual protocols to be used as an LP token. Increased liquidity and TVL for USDs will lead to a higher staking yield for SPA stakers. Greater staking yield will encourage users to stake their xSPA tokens to gain a share of potentially larger future yields and participate in governance.Apart from that the Sperax protocol is also working on the designs of a CDP stablecoin. In future users who would acquire ARB tokens can be potentially converted into minters of the CDP token through incentives like fee rebates.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy. [Please also justify why these specific KPIs will indicate that the grant has met its objective. Distribution of the grant itself should not be one of the KPIs.]Major KPIsTVL of the pools incentivized through the grant programFee income for pools incentivized through the grant programAn increase in the TVL of the pools to which incentives will be distributed is the key matrix to measure the success of the grant program. Apart from TVL, we would also look at the Fees collected in the pools, greater fees would mean greater organic economic activity.We would use the Graph protocol to create subgraphs for all the Demeter rewarder contracts. Anyone could verify the distribution of the rewards and the resulting KPIs.Grant Timeline and Milestones: [Describe the timeline for the grant, including ideal milestones with respective KPIs.

[Clearly explain how the inputs of your program justify the expected benefits to the DAO. Be very clear and tangible, and you must back up your claims with data]USDs is a simple DeFi product that has the potential to bring in retail users through organic auto-yield. New users would then be willing to explore other DeFi products which are part of the ecosystem.Incentives through Demeter would foster deeper concentrated liquidity for other tokens apart from Sperax tokens.Since Demeter is permissionless, other protocols can also create proposals to ask for incentives on their farms. This would solve the problem of initial liquidity for protocols launching on Arbitrum.Arbitrum is the chain of choice for several perpetual protocols. Increased USDs TVL and trading activity would help USDs acquire a Chainlink oracle. Once USDs has a chainlink oracle it would be possible for perp protocols to add USDs as a liquidity pool token. This would reduce the reliance on perp protocols on inorganic emissions.With the launch of Demeter - we attracted about 10K users directly to the sperax ecosystem in the first five months with about $2Mn in TVL while the ecosystem users crossed over 250K.image1442×824 81.4 KBDo you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

This innovation transforms the traditional LP experience, which has long been characterized as high-risk, high-reward, and complex, into an avenue where liquidity providers can tap into diverse revenue streams beyond conventional swap fees.Especially for LPDfi protocols, users can expect higher yields. Cause Fragmenting and separately managing liquidity allows current tick liquidity to earn swap fees in AMMs, while unused liquidity can be lent as options or perpetual for premium earnings, enhancing capital efficiency.We’re actively developing liquidity management vaults on top of LPDfi protocols, making LPDfi more accessible and user-friendly. We aim to stand as a pivotal gate connecting users and LPDfi protocols, contributing to the growth and stability of DeFi liquidity.By simplifying LP on LPDfi protocols, the Arbitrum ecosystem can attract more liquidity to the Arbitrum chain, more specifically to DEXes, resulting in more smooth trading activities, minimising slippage, and enhancing user experience.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:Yes, all of our LP tokens are ERC-20 tokens, which can be widely used in the DeFi space. Additionally, we already developed automated liquidity management vaults on top of AMMs and LPDfi protocols as follows:UniswapCamelotStryke (Formerly Dopex)Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?As for similar projects, Logarithm has a plan to launch the LPDfi vault but not live yet.

More details are better, including how you arrived at the required funding for individual categories of expenses covered by your grant plan]To determine the target TVL, we use the WETH-USDC vault on Gamma Strategies as our benchmark. Gamma Strategies’ vault and Orange Finance’s vault are in the same category, Liquidity Management, and have similar risk/return structures, though each product focuses different area (Gamma focuses on Normal CLAMM like Uniswap v3, while Orange focuses on LPDfi protocols).As explained in the “novelty/innovation” section, LP can expect higher yields from LPDfi protocols. LPDfi protocol utilises CLAMM such as Uniswap v3 as underlying liquidity, and liquidity providers can earn swap fees from the current tick liquidity, while unused liquidity can be lent as options or perpetual for premium earnings, enhancing capital efficiency. Therefore, we expect our vault on LPDfi protocols can accumulate more liquidity with higher fee APR and lower reward APR.Considering Liquidity providers may incur losses due to price fluctuation of deposited assets on AMM, users demand higher compensation when they deposit liquidity into pools like WETH-USDC compared to stable yield opportunities or pegged pairs.Gamma has 3.77M TVL now with APR APR (average fee APR+current reward APR): 122.4%(69.8%+52.6%).  We get an average fee APR on Gamma from DeFiLlama (Get the average fee APR, as this APR fluctuates a lot day by day compared to the reward APR).Gamma’s TVL/APR ratio: 3.77M/120% = 3083333.333333333333333WETH-USDC on Gamma Strategies.numbersAs we aim to reach $4M TVL, our target APR is $4M/3083333.333333333333333 = 129.7%We plan to incentivize liquidity providers with a 129.7% APR (fee APR + Reward APR ) for the 12-week program.The current avg. fee APR on the Stryke is about 97.28% fee APR (59.18k fee in 2 weeks * 24/ $1.45M TVL) on WETH-USDC CLAMM. Given that the utilization rate of liquidity for the option purchase stays mostly 99% with the growing TVL and that Stryke is now discounting option premiums during the STIP reward period, we estimate the average. fee APR remains the same or higher at the level of $4M TVL.app.dopex.ioDopexDopex is a maximum liquidity and minimal exposure options protocolTherefore, we aim to distribute 32.4% APR (=129.7% - 97.3%) by ARB LTIPP grant.$4M * 32.4%APR = $1,296,000 (annual)In 12 weeks,$1,296,000/ 52weeks *12weeks = about $300,000, equivalent to 150,000 ARB ($2 per ARB)Grant Matching: [Enter Amount of Matching Funds Provided - If Relevant]We don’t have a native token yet.Grant Breakdown: [Please provide a high-level overview of the budget breakdown and planned use of funds]The grant will be distributed through our point program “Orange LockDrop” as follows:Users earn points by locking ETH/WBTC/ARB for more than 6 months and referring friends.The funds locked will be managed through the Orange ALM vault on the Stryke CLAMM pools.At the TGE, our native tokens will be distributed proportionally according to the amount of points earned.For the first 3 months, the LTIPP grant will be distributed proportionally to participants according to the amount of points earned.That means we don’t determine the allocation for each pool but allocate based on pointsTarget Vault: the vaults on the Stryke CLAMM pool of WETH- USDC, ARB-USDC, and WBTC-USDC.We may list additional target vaults on our partnered LPDfi protocols (Smilee, InfinityPools, Limitless, and Marginzero) once the smart contract gets audited and deployed respectively.Milestone for grant: Grant will not be distributed if TVL does not exceed the predetermined milestone threshold.

Non-distributed grants will be sent back to the Arbitrum Foundation.Product development/ Risk management:We may list additional target vaults on our partnered LPDfi protocols (Smilee, InfinityPools, Limitless, and Marginzero) once the smart contract gets audited and deployed respectively.Only audited contracts will be used for the grant distribution.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric? [Provide relevant design and implementation details]We will introduce the point program “Orange LockDrop”, described in the Grant Breakdown section. This system asks users to lock their funds in our ALM vault for more than 6 months, incentivising them with our future native token rewards.As the user’s liquidity will be locked for more than 6 months, incentivised by not only the ARB grant but also our future native token rewards, this makes liquidity sticky to LPDfi protocols through the  Orange ALM vault.Besides, our automated liquidity management strategy delivers sustainable yield opportunities from swap fees, option premiums, and funding rates from AMM/LPDfi protocols.Especially for LPDfi protocols, users can expect higher yields. Fragmenting and separately managing liquidity allows current tick liquidity to earn swap fees in AMMs, while unused liquidity can be lent as options or perpetual for premium earnings, enhancing capital efficiency.With this proposal, we aim to reach more DeFi users, attracting more liquidity to the LPDfi space through Orange Finance, where fees alone can be sustainable and real yield for users, thereby liquidity becomes anchored on Orange Finance and LPDfi protocols even after the end of ARB rewards.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy. [Please also justify why these specific KPIs will indicate that the grant has met its objective. Distribution of the grant itself should not be one of the KPIs.]TVL: 4M (Source of Truth: Orange dApp, Dune)Since the launch, Our vault on the Stryke WETH-USDC CLAMM pool has swiftly surpassed $1M in TVL within just one week, accounting for approximately 80% of the WETH-USDC CLAMM TVL, and comprising half of Stryke’s overall TVL. We expect that more liquidity would be deposited into the Stryke CLAMM pools, once we deploy the ALM vault on the ARB-USDC and the WBTC-USDC pools.According to the Dopex Bi-Weekly Update (2024-03-08), the latest stats are as follows:Average daily volumes: ~1.8MAverage TVL: 2.5MDopex Bi-Weekly Update (March 08, 2024)We expect Stryke would get more than $5M TVL, $4M from Orange’s ALM vault (80% share),  and this amount of TVL facilitates$5M TVL * ($1.8 daily volume / $2.5M TVL) = $3.6M average daily trading volume.The utilisation rate still stays around 99% level in the ticks near the spot price. Therefore, it is clear that there is a huge demand for more TVL for trading options and daily trading volume on Stryke would grow significantly by accumulating more liquidity through Orange FInance’s ALM vault, which deposits/manages liquidity into ticks around the spot price, incentivized by the “Orange Lockdrop” campaign with ARB incentives.The percentage of users retaining deposits beyond 6 months: 50% (Dune)Our main objective through the grant is to scale liquidity for the long run by incentivizing the campaign “Orange Lockdrop”, where users need to lock ETH/WBTC/ARB for more than 6 months. This KPI indicates how many percent of users participate in the campaign.Grant Timeline and Milestones: [Describe the timeline for the grant, including ideal milestones with respective KPIs. Include at least one milestone that shows progress en route to a final outcome. Please justify the feasibility of these milestones.]Milestone 1: Allocated 50% of the grant (75,000 ARB) to achieve TVL $2M, otherwise the grant will not be distributed and we will send them back to the Arbitrum Foundation.Milestone 2: Allocated another 50% of the grant (75,000 ARB) to achieve TVL $4M, otherwise the grant will not be distributed and we will send them back to the Arbitrum Foundation.MilestoneTargetGrant AllocationDeadlineIn case of failureMilestone 1$2M TVL through the Campaign “Orange LockDrop”75,000 ARB12 weeksThe grant will not be distributed and we will send them back to the Arbitrum Foundation.Milestone 2$4M TVL through the Campaign “Orange LockDrop”75,000 ARB12 weeksThe grant will not be distributed and we will send them back to the Arbitrum Foundation.How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem? [Clearly explain how the inputs of your program justify the expected benefits to the DAO. Be very clear and tangible, and you must back up your claims with data]In the dynamic realm of DeFi, liquidity reigns supreme – it is the lifeblood that fuels the ecosystem. Deep liquidity is essential for DEXes to facilitate smooth trading activities, minimize slippage, and enhance user experience. However, the DeFi landscape is still grappling with the challenges of insufficient liquidity on DEXes, largely due to the complex user interfaces and the risk-reward imbalance inherent in the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model for Liquidity Providers (LPs).LPDfi is emerging as a pivotal narrative, signifying a major shift towards more innovative and efficient liquidity solutions as explained in the “stickiness” question above. However, LPDfi requires liquidity providers for further complex and active liquidity management with advanced financial knowledge.It can be said that this complexity has hindered LPDfi protocols attracting liquidity, despite yields being more capital-efficient and higher compared to normal AMM. Indeed, the utilization rates of liquidity on Stryke are nearly 100% (which means demand for option is much larger than supplied liquidity) at the moment.Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 14.58.191920×980 112 KBBy simplifying the LP UI/UX, the ALM for LPDfi can be the solution to this issue, helping LPDfi protocols to attract more liquidity which goes to AMMs on the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are confident that Orange Finance, LPDfi protocols and AMMs on the Arbitrum ecosystem can attract more liquidity by reaching more DeFi users through the program.By offering an ALM vault, we simplify the UI/UX for LPDfi protocols, effectively addressing the liquidity challenges they face. Through LPDfi protocols, this also facilitates a significant increase in liquidity flow towards Automated Market Makers (AMMs) within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Through this program, Orange Finance, LPDfi protocols, and AMMs on the Arbitrum ecosystem are ready to attract more liquidity by reaching a wider DeFi user base.Indeed, Since the launch, Our vault has swiftly surpassed $1M in TVL within just one week, accounting for approximately 80% of the WETH-USDC CLAMM TVL (1.24M /1.51M), and comprising half of Stryke’s overall TVL (1.24M / 2.64M).The utilisation rate still stays around 99% level in the ticks near the spot price. Therefore, daily trading volume on Stryke should grow significantly by accumulating more liquidity through Orange FInance’s ALM vault, which deposits/manages liquidity into ticks around the spot price, incentivized by the “Orange Lockdrop” campaign with ARB incentives.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?YesSECTION 5: Data and ReportingOpenBlock Labs has developed a comprehensive data and reporting checklist for tracking essential metrics across participating protocols.

If you don’t know what KPI might be relevant for you or how to properly define them, please refer to the following document:[Arbitrum DAO] OpenBlock Labs Incentive Onboarding SpecThe nature of Jones vaults are “deploy and forget”, which aligns with our vision of making DeFi simple for users. For this reason, we think that TVL is the most important KPIs for us.TVL of Arbitrum Vaults:DATE01/10/2301/11/2301/12/2301/01/2401/02/2401/03/2401/04/24TVL ($M)16.714.919.72830.827.320.2TVL %0%-11%+32%+42%+10%-11%-26%1600×699 75.5 KBSource: https://dune.com/rebeca/jones-dao-stip-performanceFrom the above visuals, it is evident that Jones experienced a large uplift in TVL during the STIP program. This resulted in a scenario where the increase in TVL to the Jones protocol was greater than the ARB amount distributed for the vast amount of time during the campaign.Alongside new deposits, incentivized Jones strategies such as jGLP grew in market value. For users, this was a great outcome as they received rewards from one of the most simple campaigns around, while being able to capture the effects of an upward-trending market, which provided them an incredible STIP experience!6. [Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?One of the lessons we learned from STIP is that, to amplify success, we need to foster more cooperation and collaboration with partners ahead of STIP campaign launch. One of the campaigns we wished had a stronger presence was our campaign for wjAURA. While the rewards for wjAURA on Arbitrum were great, we did not see as much composability & cooperation from partners as we would have liked, and the utility of this product on the new chain (the result of a migration from ETH Mainnet to Arbitrum) didn’t grow as much as we wanted. This resulted in the lion’s share of rewards being absorbed by whales with a large wjAURA presence on Arbitrum.We were not unhappy with the campaign, since the overall number of users and TVL of the jAURA strategy increased, but we want to make sure people are staying with the protocol and more importantly, staying on Arbitrum. This is why we think that downsizing the relative % amount of rewards per category, plus targeting Arbitrum ecosystem integrations more this time rather than the native farms themselves, could be a way to have more capital efficiency.Another lesson would be to focus more on retention after the conclusion of our campaign.For jGLP, we experienced a decrease in TVL after the STIP campaign concluded. By studying the top wallets holding jGLP, and by interviewing some of our user base, we can confidently assert that the new tokens stayed within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and specifically stayed in the GMX ecosystem, where they migrated to GMX V2 after rewards ceased. We hope that by launching a brand new incentives campaign centered around our new GMX V2 vault strategy, we will bring many of those users back to Jones and keep them satisfied for the long term, increasing the retention rate.In order to improve the odds of a positive TVL flow for the GMX V2 strategy, we will begin a marketing campaign, both internally and externally, to push users to migrate from jGLP to jGM. This may happen organically, but we will be doing everything we can from our side to increase awareness and education. We hope that users will be very impressed with the performance of our strategy over orchestrating their own GM strategies, and stick with us like many of our jGLP holders have done. Better performance in retaining TVL after the end of this iteration of the program would mean a marked improvement in the performance of our campaign.Finally, in our initial STIP campaign, we wanted to deploy a portion of the incentives towards our new product, jLP. jLP is a concentrated liquidity manager that is highly composable, with specific innovations that give it the Jones ‘touch’. We effectively released jLP in a beta state (labeled under “Jones Lab”) to gather initial feedback from users in terms of overall experience. After gathering this feedback and gathering data, we were not satisfied that the results produced were suitable for a STIP campaign that would provide enough value to users. As a consequence, we have been working for the last 4 months on the underlying infrastructure to be able to achieve the functionalities mentioned above as well as others beyond that scope. This time, we plan to utilize a portion of the STIP rewards to bootstrap this new revamped product.New Plans for STIP Bridge7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?1M ARB (50% of the original STIP amount)8. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]No9. [Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?We plan to allocate as following:New Tokenomics: 5% - 12.5% (target: 10%)Jones will release a new token format with a gamified mechanism for locking and redeeming tokens, alongside the ability to participate in strategic token purchases derived from protocol revenue. ARB rewards will be used to incentivise the conversion and locking of JONES tokens. This product is currently in audit and should be released during May.For the jGM/jUSDC Ecosystem: 30% - 85% (target: 50%)ARB tokens for the jGM/jUSDC ecosystem are expected to be distributed in three parts. On one side to incentivise deposits and boost jUSDC APR, on another to bootstrap and boost jGM APR, and the last for partners who could offer integrations such as lending & borrowing markets on top of these strategies (ie: Dolomite for example).The split between jGM, jUSDC, and partners will be established on a week to week basis, since these strategies may receive yield boosts that will potentially be subject to other incentives placed on top by integrators. jGM will allow people to enjoy a product similar in structure to jGLP, in which a basket of GM tokens (gmETH, gmBTC, gmARB, gmSOL, among others) will be leveraged and algorithmically balanced against the borrowed USDC tokens provided by the jUSDC vault, which will enjoy a portion of the yield generated by jGM. jGM is currently in audit and should be released during MayFor the jLP Ecosystem: 10% - 49% (target: 40%)As highlighted above in section 6, jLP will be the full iteration of our current Jones Labs automated V3 liquidity strategy offering, which is currently open to users. The vaults will have new innovations like: bull / bear / neutral strategies, limit / exit orders, and other functionalities that are not available in other products which will be announced on launch. The revamped infrastructure is currently going through audit and should be released during the first half of the STIP bridge.We will also attempt to coordinate with partners, especially lenders, to be able to spin up composable utility for the vault tokens right away. We plan to support of Uniswap and Camelot from day 1 (Camelot already publicly supported, Uniswap supported on our backend), and to open vaults specifically for blue chip pairs (ie: ARBETH, ETHUSDC) and other native arbitrum coins, with neutral(s), bull, and bear strategies available at launch.Distribution Strategy:Our strategy relies not only on products that we are confident will be released within the specified timeline, but also agreements with partners which may require development of some infrastructure. For this reason, we have provided specific ranges with ideal targets and would like to reserve the right to redirect any or all of the incentives outlined towards certain subsets of products to others.For jLP, since we have been building the infrastructure internally for the last 6 months, we can consider the full release a ""new product”, but it is not really something new. We have seen that during the last quarter, without specific marketing push and effort, this strategy has accumulated more than 600k USD in TVL at the peak. We are looking to push most of our efforts in the form of upgrades in order to reach a TVL that is at least x10 higher than what we realized with minimal effort. All in all we see our current lineup as an upgrade of what we have: jGM is an upgrade of jGLP which proved PMF, jLP will be a total revamp in user experience and functionality compared to what we achieved through the Jones Labs branding.Accordingly, not only market conditions but also security may have an impact on distribution. To us, security is paramount, we wouldn’t put out a non secure product even if we have incentives on top.KPIs:For STIP Addendum, we are focusing on only 3 indicators of performance.TVL - Our mission has always been to create ‘set and forget’ vaults that make earning yield easy for users. We want to stick to this mission, which means we don’t put a lot of emphasis on interactions from users as a performance metric. Typically, they are much less than other protocols, and that is a good indicator of how effective our strategies are at allowing users to “park” their tokens in our vaults. Therefore, to Jones TVL is paramount since it is a direct proxy of the interest of markets and users.TVL Retention - Being able to retain 50% or more of the TVL brought in by the STIP Addendum program would be a marked improvement over STIP Round 1.New Users: - Since we are releasing jLP as a ‘new strategy’, we recognize that this product should attract more users. So an increase in new users will be a useful metric to check the performance of jGM, but especially important for jLP.10. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?jUSDC: 0xB0BDE111812EAC913b392D80D51966eC977bE3A2 - This contract was recently re-deployed as a result of upgrades made to jUSDC that enabled the addition of the jGM strategy.jGM: TBDwjAURA OFT (Arbitrum): 0xcB9295ac65De60373A25C18d2044D517ed5da8A9jLP: TBD11. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?We think looking at ecosystems like Optimism & Uniswap, with fleshed out governance models, would be great for the Arbitrum DAO team to take some notes from. Arbitrum is a different DAO: likely the most decentralized available and also the one with the highest amount of participation. For this reason, the goal is not to copy, but to iterate and improve on what they have already done.In terms of support via official tracking sites, it would be very attractive to see in-house versions of the 3rd-party information that was shared by the community during the lead up to STIP Round 1. These information spreadsheets and sites covered things such as: how much ARB each protocol was asking for, which protocols passed quorum, and which protocols were likely to receive their grants. A centralized hub for info on the incentive program, and if possible on all incentive programs, would be immensely helpful for transparency and project discovery.Learning from other ecosystems and implementing official tracking tools will make it easier for the DAO to help Arbitrum grow and create opportunities for protocols & users to attract more attention to the chain by word-of-mouth or targeted marketing.Finally, having measurement metrics that take into account what has happened on Arbitrum, and more specifically protocols on Arbitrum, normalized for what has also happened in the market, would be a good way to properly understand the effectiveness of these programs."

Please provide references knowledgeable about past work, where relevant. If you wish to do so privately, indicate that. [Optional, but recommended]):The success of the project itself speaks to the team’s capabilities. The Pyth Data Association (PDA) and Douro Labs (DL) teams have been developing Pyth Network for almost 3 years now. Pyth launched its cross-chain oracle in December 2022 and over the past year has grown to be the second-most integrated oracle in the world.  The product itself powers numerous protocols across different verticals, including perps, borrow/lending, and stablecoins.The PDA team has led the ecosystem growth to more than 90 data publishers and more than 170 applications powered by Pyth (including the close collaboration with Vela, HMX and Synthetix). The team has also enabled the growth of the Pyth community to 70k members and more than 160k wallets of $PYTH stakers. Individuals responsible for this success include : Marc, Pierre, Ed, Mario, Ani, Ali, Guillermo, and other contributors from Douro Labs or the Pyth Data AssociationThe Core Engineering team at Douro Labs, led by Jayant, has led the build out of the Pyth protocol from inception, the v1 delivery using aggregation on-chain on Solana and expanding it to an appchain (Pythnet) with the ability of low-latency delivery of data to multiple chains (53 to date)Pyth Data Association and Douro Labs have delivered data feeds that are unmatched in performance (updates every 400ms at subsecond latency) and user protection through working closely with application to implement commit-and-reveal schemes that protect against front running. Below are examples of how application on Arbitrum have used Pyth:Vela Exchange | Pyth NetworkHow HMX Uses Pyth | Pyth Network Case Study | Pyth NetworkOn designing and implementing effective incentives, The Pyth Data Association recently performed the Pyth Network Retrospective Airdrop, which allocated 2.5% of its token supply to on-chain users of #PoweredByPyth applications and 1% directly to protocols being #PoweredByPyth. The airdrop primarily recognized usage of Pyth price feeds by applications and extended the rewards to users of such applications.Airdrop Phase 1 dropped PYTH tokens to DeFi users across 27 chains. Then, this airdrop was the largest cross-chain airdrop ever performed — over 52K wallets have claimed their PYTH tokens. Airdrop Phase 2 rewarded over 160 DeFi protocols using the Pyth Price Feeds.The Pyth Network Retrospective Airdrop was highly successful in galvanizing and growing the Pyth community (400K PYTH token holders today). The Airdrop was also covered in various media outlets (Coindesk, or The Block among others), and close to 200K wallets are staking PYTH in governance.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?The Pyth Network oracle is a permissionless pull oracle offering about 450 price feeds on Arbitrum. The price feeds range from crypto assets to FX, metals, equities, ETF and US rates.Permissionlessness: no need to contact the team, just read the documentation and become powered by PythPull oracle: do not comprise on price accuracy, if you need to know the current price on-chain, trigger a price updateExtensive price feeds catalogue: whether you’re building a crypto-focused platform or RWA one, you have access to 450 price feeds today — and the catalogue keeps growing!13840×2160 84.7 KBThe ability of multiple applications to trigger price updates on-demand enables applications to avoid front and back-running attacks that emanate from applications using push-model oracles, where the price on-chain is already known. The pull-model also allows applications to implement commit-and-reveal schemes that reduce the number of transactions on-chain (including price updates) to those related to a trade committed to by the user.The ability to subsidise the costs related to such price updates will enable multiple applications to trigger a higher number of updates independently and allow their users to use prices with the highest levels of freshness and reduce the risk of front-runningIs your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:The Pyth Price Feeds are by nature composable as it can power DeFi applications. Additionally, the 400+ Pyth prices are permissionlessly available to anyone — no need for API keys or permissions.Various leading Arbitrum applications are already using Pyth: HMX, Vela, Perennial, Synonym, KTX Finance, WINR, Cega, Deri, Rage Trade, Pingu Exchange, Pike Finance, TigrisLTIPP applicants like Synthetix or KTX and others would further grow the Pyth oracle footprint on Arbitrum.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?Chainlink, Redstone, Stork, and others according to Defillama.As of today, Pyth is the second most used oracle on Arbitrum after Chainlink.How do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs)Being a permissionless pull/on-demand oracle powering applications on multiple chains, one of the key metric for growth and retention is the number of applications powered by Pyth, the number of developers and the associated size of activities performed by those applications. As can be verified by the chart below, the number of applications and associated developers using Pyth services has increased constantly, exceeding any churn from applications ceasing operations.Untitled (1)1920×1080 94.2 KBTo further demonstrate usage of Pyth data, the chart below shows the number of (daily) price updates by protocols that need this information to operate — Every Pyth price update on-chain is deemed related to the execution of a transaction on the application where the user triggered the update and the application committing the data on-chain (for a gas fee of $2 as of end of February).Screenshot 2024-03-17 2304542500×631 50 KBRelevant usage metrics - Please refer to the OBL relevant metrics chart 23. For your category (DEX, lending, gaming, etc) please provide a list of all respective metrics as well as all metrics in the general section:Daily Active Users: As of today, about 230 distinct smart contracts have integrated and interacted permissionlessly with the Pyth oracle (triggering or reading price updates). Until now, over 7,500 unique users have interacted with an application powered by Pyth.Daily User Growth: Deployed in Q3 2022, the Pyth smart contract saw 169 smart contracts integrating by end of 2023. In the past 2.5 months, an additional 57 contracts started using the Pyth oracle. Until the end of 2023, around 5,000 wallets had interacted with a smart contract powered by Pyth. Since the start of 2024, the number grew 50% ; from 5K to 7.5KDaily Transaction Count: Since deployment, a total of 475,000 price updates were permissionlessly triggered by any of these 230 smart contracts. There were a total of 207,000 price updates done in 2023 (about 567 / day), and since the beginning of 2024 (2.5 months), the number of price updates triggered is 270,000 (or 3,5000 / day), a 6x increase compared to 2023.Daily Protocol Fee: As of today, the Pyth oracle collects 1 wei for every price feed updated on-chain. Therefore the Pyth protocol fee is equal to the daily transaction count mentioned above (1 wei x number of updates).Daily Transaction Fee: Over the last 15 months, over 1850 $ETH have been spent by applications powered by Pyth to update price feeds and effectively use that price (trade, liquidations etc). Since 2024, 650 ETH have been spent (8 ETH / day or ) to do the requested price updates (270,000).Incentivized User List & Gini: The Pyth Activity by apps Dune query shows all contracts that updated a price feed in 2024, and display the number of updates triggered as well as the gas cost incurred to do so (from 2024 also). Once LTIPP starts, dates will be updated to match the grant period and this data will be used as reference for the weekly refunding of the cost incurred to update the Pyth price feeds.Total Value Secured: As of today, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum is around $175M.Total Trading Volume enabled: Pyth has enabled over $40B in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges (HMX, Vela, WINR, CAP, KTX, Level Finance, SynFutures, Pingu Exchange, Perennial, Gambit, Deri V4, Buffer, Cryptex Finance and Tigris Trade).Dune Dashboard: https://dune.com/cctdaniel/pyth-arbitrum-ltippDo you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan:Yes. The usage of this LTIPP will be activity based and aims to offset the cost incurred by applications.Did you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal? If so, please disclose the details of that arrangement here, including conflicts of interest (Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant):No, this was drafted by contributors from the Pyth Data Association with the help from Douro Labs.SECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?:No.On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:The Pyth oracle contract is deployed on over 50 chains (mainnet), ranging from EVM, to Cosmwasm, Move chains and Solana or NEAR.You can find all EVM contracts here, Move ones, Cosmwasm here, or Solana and NEAR in our documentation.What date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?:The Pyth oracle contract has been deployed on Arbitrum on Sep-09-2022 03:56:19 PM +UTC with this tx.Do you have a native token?:Yes the Pyth Network has a governance token: $PYTH.For tokenomics please refer to the documentation and for the initial token launch, read on here.To find all PYTH token addresses (including on Arbitrum), refer to the docs.Past Incentivization:The Pyth Network has had to date, two major ‘incentivization’ events:Pyth Retrospective Airdrop: Phase 1 - DeFi ParticipantsPyth Retrospective Airdrop: Phase 2 - Decentralized AppsThe phase 1 allocated 2.5% of PYTH total supply to end-users of applications powered by Pyth. This involved 90K wallets from 27 different chains. Over 2/3 of the airdrop has been claimed almost 4 months after the launch.The phase 2 allocated and distributed 1% of the PYTH token supply directly to applications/DAOs integrated with the Pyth oracle.These 2 phases have lead close to 200K unique wallets to stake (1.2B) PYTH tokens in governance. After Ethereum, Solana, and Celestia, the Pyth Network is the 4th biggest network in distinct stakers.The Pyth Network has never received grants incentivizing Pyth usage from any ecosystem it is available on.Current Incentivization:As of today (past Phase 1 and 2 of the Pyth Retrospective Airdrop), only Pyth Data Publishers are rewarded for publishing data to the network. Rewards are allocated to each publishers based on this ranking which depend on the number on which a publisher is active (with enough quality data).No grants were received from the Arbitrum foundation nor any participant in the Arbitrum ecosystem.Protocol Performance:According to DefiLlama, over 30 applications are powered by Pyth on Arbitrum.Additionally, and as mentioned before, being a permissionless pull/on-demand oracle, demonstration of usage are the number of (daily) price updates by protocols that need this information to operate properly.Specifically for Arbitrum, the oracle is now delivering about 4,000 to 6,0000 price updates daily to apps powered by Pyth (according to the Dune Dashboard).Screenshot 2024-03-17 2304542500×631 50 KBIn regards to trading volume enabled, the Pyth Price Feeds already secured over $40B in trading volume. Looking further than Arbitrum, over $120B trading volume has been enabled thanks to the Pyth Price feeds.Protocol Roadmap:The Pyth Network is operated by the Pyth DAO, and so future endeavors will have to be decided/approved by the PYTH stakers and the Pyth DAO Councils.Nonetheless, contributors such as the Pyth Data Association and Douro Labs have focused on 2 new endeavors:Pyth Entropy — Pyth Entropy allows developers to quickly and easily generate secure random numbers on the blockchain for applications such as NFT mints, gaming, and more. Pyth Entropy is currently available on several EVM networks.Pyth Express Relay — enables an efficient and secure liquidation process for DeFi applications that traditionally have had to share most of liquidation revenues with block miners. This protocol is already deployed on testnet and both applications and searchers have started testing it.Audit History & Security Vendors:The Pyth oracle has undergone many and thorough audits from reputable companies such as OtterSec, Trail of Bits and Asymmetric Research.You can find all Pyth related audits here, they involve either the oracle itself as well as the Pyth DAO and governance aspect of the network. Within the past 2 years, 14 audits have been done.A bug bounty program also exists, rewarding up to $500K for critical finds — you can find all the details (in-scope as well as process) here.Security Incidents:Neither the oracle nor governance smart contracts were ever exploited.Regarding the Pyth Price Feeds themselves (and an inaccurate price to be produced), we’d need to go back to September 2021 (2 months after the V1 launch).You can find the full RCA on our blog. Issue was since fixed on the code side and the whole reliability and benchmarks used by the oracle have since been massively upgraded. Please refer to the blog; Reliability at Pyth, for discovering Pyth security practices for price feeds.SECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONDetail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.Requested Grant Size:1,000,000 ARB (revised post Dencun)Justification for the size of the grant:The Grant will be used to improve the access to price feeds for Arbitrum-based DeFi apps at no cost — this will enable DeFi applications to a. increase the number of assets supported on their protocol, b. alleviate the cost burden from users or dApps, c. further optimize applications UX (less fees charged to users, more granular price updates).A Pyth price update cost about $1 (we currently see a moving average of $0.8 post Dencun, down from $5 per-dencun, but expect it to slightly increase) to apps or end-users, so with the goal to reach 25,000 price updates per day, this would translate to a spending of $25,000 daily in gas fees (or 2,100,000$ for the 12 weeks duration of the LTIPP).$2,100,000 would translate to 1,240,000 ARB at today’s prices (lower than the requested amount). With the Dencun upgrade now live and the transaction costs remaining under $1 for now (only 3 days of history), we believe the gap is reasonably within the measurement error.Grant Matching:The PDA has a strong history of incentivizing both Data Publishers and DeFi Users. The Pyth Retrospective Airdrop (Phase 1 and 2) has rewarded DeFi applications and users using Pyth on Arbitrum. Within the 2 phases, over 25M PYTH were distributed to Arbitrum users and applications.Specifically part of this LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association has not planned to match any grant amount received ; one of the reason being that apps like Vela or HMX have recently received significant Pyth retrospective airdrop.Grant Breakdown:1,000,000 for gas fees update rebates — this will be activity based and disbursed on a weekly basisFunding Address:0x4133F561B747F6cd2ECd4f03515A632F5e4D8C8DFunding Address Characteristics:2/3 multisig, signers are contributors to the Pyth Data AssociationMarc Tillement, DirectorGiulio Alessio, Head of OperationsEdward Zuo, Head of GrowthTreasury Address:The Pyth DAO funds can be found here: kiXuGDcVfXpFqKw2oKMnwbi1nJaGayqRBXucgQGe9GK — this is a Solana SPL addressAdditionally, any funds held in any contracts owned by the DAO are its property. For instance, on Arbitrum, the Pyth DAO also owns all the funds in this address: 0xff1a0f4744e8582df1ae09d5611b887b6a12925cContract Address:0xff1a0f4744e8582DF1aE09D5611b887B6a12925CSECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESClearly outline the primary objectives of the program and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), execution strategy, and milestones used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the program aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.Objectives:The grant aims to use ARB to implement a rebate program to applications for gas fees related to Pyth price updates on Arbitrum.Execution Strategy:Allocation of ARB incentives within a total of 12-weeks for the improvement of performance and access to Pyth price feeds:1,000,000 ARB to implement a rebate program to DeFi applications on Arbitrum for gas fees related to price updates. the distribution will incentivise both existing and new consumers of the Pyth data and gradually increase as the number of updates committed  on-chain increases. the program will last for 12 weeks with a 4-week ramp-up to engage with existing and new applications.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric?To enhance stickiness of activity and ensure sustained engagement with Pyth on Arbitrum, the incentive design includes multiple strategies:Gas rebates incentives combined with application co-marketing campaigns will be used to seed critical mass adoption of Arbitrum-based applications powered by Pyth Price Feeds, and on-going engagement over time;Incentives to Pyth community users to use Arbitrum-based applications enables pollination of  new usage using a community that is using DeFi applications on other chains and expands the pool of dedicated users on Arbitrum;Emphasis on Continuous Product Innovation through the increase of performance, reduction of latency and deployment of innovative protocols that enable applications to improve UX and compete;Encourage involvement in Governance through gradual delivery of rewards and the fostering of deeper connections with the Arbitrum ecosystem. Pyth has already one of the highest staking ratios in all of Web3, and we expect to onboard many new applications and users to use Price Feeds through ARB rewards; andWhile the initial incentives aim to accelerate the bootstrapping phase, Pyth has built in a sustainable business model that removes the ongoing reliance on such incentives and that allows for Applications and Data Publishers to be incentivised in participation over the long-term.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy.The various KPIs for the LTIPP are:Daily Active Users (smart contracts): As of today, about 230 distinct smart contracts have integrated and interacted permissionlessly with the Pyth oracle (triggering or reading price updates). With the incentivizes in places and the growing Arbitrum developers ecosystem, goal is to reach 750 by the end of the LTIPP.Daily Active Users (end users): Until now, over 7,750 unique users have interacted with an application powered by Pyth. With the LTIPP, there will be more powered by Pyth apps and those will be more competitive in offering the best UX to users ; thus, we’re aiming for over 40,000 distinct users at the end of LTIPP.Daily Transaction Count: There were a total of 207,000 price updates done in 2023 (about 567 / day), and since the beginning of 2024 (2.5 months), the number of price updates triggered is 270,000 (or 3,500 / day), a 6x increase compared to 2023. Through this LTIPP, the goal is to have 25,000 updates / day, or in other words, an increased activity by 2x from the last know peak (13k updates on March 16th).Total Value Secured: By the end of the LTIPP, goal is to have $500M of TVL secured by the Pyth Price Feeds. TVL metrics are predominantly driven by money-market protocols (like Aave, Radiant or Silo) while Pyth footprint on Arbitrum til date is massively geared towards derivatives (that require less TVL). Thus, goal is that by the end of LTIPP the Pyth Price Feeds would secure a leading money-market on Arbitrum.Total Trading Volume enabled: With LTIPP (and so offsetting the gas costs to dApps and to end users), we’re expecting powered by Pyth applications to the main and best venues for trading derivatives contract. With $40B enabled over the last 18 months, the goal is to enable $50B by the end of 2024 (a 300% — from today’s average of +$2B monthly volume to over $6B monthly)The 1st 3 KPIs can be checked directly from this Dune Dashboard. Specifically, DAU here, DUG here, and DTC here. For the last 2 KPIs: TVS and Trading Volume enabled, we’ll provide consolidated metrics ad hoc with the relevant proof (for instance TVL secured by a powered by Pyth application from DefiLlama or stats/analytics page of a perpetual protocol using Pyth). The latter 2 KPIs will be provided via a Dune Dashboard but will require to be built (TO DO).Grant Timeline and Milestones:Month 1-2 (April 20th-May 29th): Deployment and Ramp-Up PeriodAdvertise and establish the ability of existing and new Arbitrum-based applications to claim ARB to claim gas rebatesKPIs to watch: number of applications using Pyth Price Feeds, number of price feed updates per dayAdvertise and establish the ability of existing and new users of Arbitrum-based applications to claim ARB weighted by activity on ArbitrumKPIs to watch: number of new users using Arbitrum-based applications, number of price feed updates per dayMonth 2-3 (May 20th - July 19th): Acceleration and VolumePush for 20 new price feeds used by Arbitrum-based applicationsKPI to watch: number of price feeds available on Arbitrum-based applicationsRebate 100% of gas fees to all Arbitrum-based applicationsKPI to watch: amount of gas used in price feed updates rebated to applications10,000 new users from the growing Pyth Community are active new users on ArbitrumKPI to watch: the increase of Pyth members using Arbitrum, volume of transaction that Pyth community members are contributing to ArbitrumHow will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?Receiving this grant will significantly impact the Arbitrum ecosystem by driving growth and fostering innovation in several ways:New applications and new price feeds on Arbitrum: By rebating gas fees, the grant will help incentivise applications operating on other-chains to adopt Arbitrum as their new/additional deploymentIncreased Application Activity: The incentive program is expected to boost DeFi activity on Arbitrum, further increasing the transaction activity on Arbitrum and establishing Arbitrum as a leading L2 ecosystem for DeFiUser Adoption: With targeted incentives for new users from existing Pyth community and beyond, the program aims to significantly increase the number of users interacting with Arbitrum-based applicationsExperimentation and Innovation: the deployment of new price feeds on Arbitrum will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem and the composability of protocols in the ecosystemEcosystem Synergies: The growth of the Pyth ecosystem will impact applications driving overall growth. The increased catalogue of price feeds, size and diversity of the Pyth community will foster higher demand on ArbitrumPyth Support for Arbitrum: Pyth, a pillar protocol in DeFi, encourages its community members to try out Arbitrum-based applications. Many applications have also shown interest in adopting Arbitrum, so this grant signals a strategic expansion that benefits both ecosystems.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?YesSECTION 5: Data and ReportingOpenBlock Labs has developed a comprehensive data and reporting checklist for tracking essential metrics across participating protocols. Teams must adhere to the specifications outlined in the provided link here: Onboarding Checklist from OBL 42. Along with this list, please answer the following:Is your team prepared to comply with OBL’s data requirements for the entire life of the program and three months following and then handoff to the Arbitrum DAO? Are there any special requests/considerations that should be considered?Yes. And no specific considerations to account for today.Does your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread that reference your OBL dashboard?Yes. The Pyth oracle being a permissionless pull model (meaning all price updates are shared/public) means that anyone can access the usage/metrics data directly on-chain. All metrics/goals stated in this LTIPP are (or will be) publicly verifiable, and it will be done so via Dune dashboards (or equivalent).*First Offense: In the event that a project does not provide a bi-weekly update, they will be reminded by an involved party (council, advisor, or program manager). Upon this reminder, the project is given 72 hours to complete the requirement or their funding will be halted.Understood.Second Offense: Discussion with an involved party (advisor, pm, council member) that will lead to understanding if funds should keep flowing or not.Understood.Third Offense: Funding is halted permanentlyUnderstood.Does your team agree to provide a final closeout report not later than two weeks from the ending date of your program?

The team has successfully bridged the best of Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), creating a stablecoin that is always native, fully backed by best-in-class tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), and offers decentralized minting and yield through its innovative ColorTrace technology.Matthew Commons: LinkedIn LinkRecent achievements include:USDV is live on 8 of 10 top DEXes by volume (soon 9 with onboarding of Camelot)Top 10 most traded token on PancakeSwapVetted and approved by Chainlink and Binance for price feed oracle deploymentOver 250K unique addresses and over 1.3M transactions since launchThe current market cap for USDV is approximately $25M, with a growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 520%Product State and Audience Segments:USDV is designed to empower ecosystem contributors by providing access to real-world yield (RWY) and facilitating seamless transactions across multiple blockchains without the need for wrapping or bridging. It is built upon the ERC-20 compatible Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) Standard, ensuring that it remains fungible across various platforms.The product targets multiple audience segments, including:DeFi users looking for attractive faming opportunities.Institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to tokenized RWAs without sacrificing liquidityEcosystem contributors, including developers and projects, looking for a stablecoin with cross-chain capabilities and transparent operations to share yield passively based on circulation contributionImpact of Incentives on Long-term Growth and Sustainability:USDV is the only stablecoin with omnichain design and passive yield sharing properties. To clarify, yield sharing is done at a project level. By accepting USDV liquidity, DeFi projects unlock a new passive stream of income at zero cost, effectively providing Arbitrum projects more funds to grow. For example, USDV can co-create and incentivize liquidity pools on Camelot (DEX), the yield generated by USDV sitting in Camelot’s pools will be passed to the team, allowing them to re-invest natively, better fund its own operations or deploy elsewhere.Incentive support from the chain is critical for attracting liquidity and growing TVL. The goal is for USDV liquidity on Arbitrum to reach critical mass, so that TVL and APR reaches balancing point to ensure long term sustainability.Incentives play a critical role in USDV’s strategy to drive adoption and enhance its ecosystem. The project has introduced innovative mechanisms, such as the ColorTrace system, allowing ecosystem contributors to earn yield based on their contribution to USDV’s circulation. This model is designed to:Encourage the minting and usage of USDV across various platforms and applications, increasing its circulation and utility.Attract and retain users by offering tangible rewards for their contributions to the ecosystem, fostering a loyal community.Support the sustainability of the project by aligning the interests of users, developers, and investors with the long-term success of USDV.With a new stream of passive income generated via yield share, protocols integrating USDV are better positioned to achieve profitability and reach the ultimate goal of self-sufficiency. USDV shares 50% of the underlying yield and charges partner protocol zero fees for integration.ExamplePancakeSwap on BSC has reached a stable TVL of $8M - of which ~50% is USDV = $4M.$4M * 5% APR * 50% / 12 = $8,000/month. USDV charges zero fees.Off-chain business:The USDV foundation is an non-profit organisation registered in the Cayman Islands. The Foundation operates as an orphan special purpose vehicle (SPV), a unique legal construct designed to isolate financial risk and to hold complete legal ownership of all reserve assets unencumbered.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?USDV introduces several innovative features to the Arbitrum ecosystem, including:Decentralized Minting and Yield: USDV is the first stablecoin that enables ecosystem contributors to mint and access real-world yield (RWY) directly. This is powered by the ColorTrace technology, which allows for decentralized minting for verified minters, making it accessible to any user.Omnichain Fungibility: Built upon the ERC-20 compatible Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) Standard, USDV eliminates the need for wrapping and bridging, ensuring seamless transactions across multiple blockchains, including Arbitrum.ColorTrace Technology: A novel token marking algorithm that attributes USDV circulation precisely to each contributor, enabling fair yield distribution. This technology ensures that USDV tokens are fully fungible regardless of their “color,” allowing users to transact interchangeably and permissionlessly across ecosystems.As USDV permeates across the Arbitrum ecosystem, every project has the opportunity to enjoy new passive income pro-rated based on their contribution to the circulation - all at zero cost.There is zero cost for projects to integrate USDV, just need to add USDV token address.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum?USDV is designed for high composability within the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond. Its use of the ERC-20 compatible OFT standard and the innovative ColorTrace technology ensures that USDV can easily integrate with various DeFi protocols, lending platforms, DEXs, and other blockchain-based applications. This compatibility fosters a collaborative environment where USDV can enhance liquidity, facilitate cross-chain transactions, and contribute to a more interconnected DeFi landscape.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?USDV is a tokenized RWA backed stablecoin. The token is ERC-20 compatible - like USDC and USDT. USDV is unique on two aspectsOmnichain: Built on LayerZero’s OFT standard, USDV is the only omnichain stablecoin in the market as of writing.Passive, equitable yield sharing with protocols: Leveraging ColorTrace, USDV allows every and any protocol within Arbitrum’s ecosystem to own a color. USDV passing through the protocol will be colored accordingly. The more USDV circulation attributable to one’s color, the more yield one gets.There may be some other protocols with retail yield sharing (ie USDM, USDY), backed by crypto assets (DAI, USDe) - but none omnichain.How do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs)Internally, USDV measures retention and success through several key performance indicators (KPIs), including:Total Value Locked (TVL): Tracking the growth in TVL provides insights into the adoption and usage of USDV within the DeFi ecosystem.Trading Volume: Measure of USDV Demand and utilityMarket Cap: Overall liquidity within an ecosystemAPR: Perceived risk of our asset, and returns required for user liquidity provisioningIncentives efficiency: Dollar TVL growth per dollar incentives deployedLiquidity depth: USDV liquidity at key venues, supporting trades and liquidationsList of DEX and Lending partners: Number of venues allowing users to access, trade, borrow, lend, farm USDVPeg integrity: How closely USDV stays pegged with USD, critical for user trust and stabilityThese metrics and KPIs guide USDV’s strategies for user acquisition, retention, and ecosystem development, aiming for long-term growth and sustainability within the Arbitrum ecosystem and the broader blockchain landscape.Do you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan:Yes, we agreed to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics.Did you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal?We do not have a grant consultant, we speak to the Arbitrum Foundation directly.# SECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSIs the protocol native to Arbitrum?Built on LayerZero’s OFT standard, USDV is the only omnichain stablecoin in the market as of writing. USDV is always native on each chain that it is deployed on, avoiding the risks & inconvenience of wrapped and bridged versions that have hampered ecosystems in the past.Token contract address on Aarbitrum: 0x323665443CEf804A3b5206103304BD4872EA4253While USDV is not exclusively native to Arbitrum, it has been developed with a strong focus on integration and optimization for the Arbitrum ecosystem.

TVL milestones are based on total TVL across different venues (i.e sum of TVL of a specific USDV pair in different DEXes).image937×477 11.4 KBReference growth - BSCUSDV liquidity grew from $4M to $11M in three months by partnering two DEXes: PancakeSwap and THENA.1072×636 21.7 KBUSDV contribution: ~$50K incentives/month and $4M own LP. This was achieved with zero incentive support from BSC Foundation.USDV incentive support has been reducing over time because of performance. For example - this March, Our USDV<> ETH pair with THENA developed into a profit-making pool requiring zero incentives. Ie THENA is making pool fees plus passive yield.Grant Matching:Baseline: USDV shares yield with its ecosystem partners. Assuming an average of $10M USDV TVL at current T-bill APR, this implies $500K p.a yield generated, of which 50% is returned to our ecosystem partners. Ie $250K generated for Arbitrum.For lending protocols, we provide greater yield sharing where the dollar value varies depending on the market borrow/supply conditions, but also expected to be in the hundreds of 1000s range.Essentially the cumulative yield generated for the Arbitrum ecosystem will evolve to par or be greater than the funds requested in this grant.Additional: Irrespective of DAO and Foundation support, USDV has been providing direct liquidity and monthly incentives to grow Arbitrum’s ecosystem.This includes but is not limited to $1M in own LP and monthly incentives of $40,000/month distributed across partners.Grant Breakdown:image785×178 3.79 KBFunding Address:arb1: 0x58f65DDD908c64905d29AB4ce67C16f068eb9EFA2 of 3 multisigTreasury Address:eth: 0x4f4c55B3a41Ab09B7a34CC2810bFC7cD4b061b3dContract Address:arb1: 0x7e34cFFB4159d9A3eFa95e2f336Ffa41CBbE386E# SECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESThe primary objectives of the USDV grant proposal are to:Enhance Liquidity: Significantly increase the liquidity of USDV on key Arbitrum-based DEXes (Camelot, Trader Joe, Uniswap) to facilitate smoother transactions and more stable pricing.Expand Use Cases: Collaborate with strategic partners (Fiat24, MugglePay) to explore and develop new payment use cases for USDV, driving its adoption beyond traditional DeFi applications.Drive Adoption and User Growth: Implement targeted marketing and community engagement strategies to grow USDV’s user base within the Arbitrum ecosystem.Strengthen Ecosystem Integrations: Foster innovation and utility by supporting projects and developers integrating USDV within the Arbitrum ecosystem through ecosystem grants.Execution Strategy:Token Distribution Method: The grant will support liquidity incentives through farming, staking, and potentially new mechanisms like referral programs to encourage long-term holding and usage of USDV.Incentivizing Key Pools: Specific allocations will be made for liquidity pools on Camelot, TraderJoe, and Uniswap, focusing on USDV and other eligible assets to enhance depth and reduce slippage.Use of Funds: Allocations will cover liquidity incentives, marketing campaigns, community events, and ecosystem grants, with a keen eye on risk management to ensure sustainable growth.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric?To ensure “stickiness” of users and liquidity, USDV will:Implement a tiered rewards system, encouraging longer-term staking or liquidity provision.Explore loyalty rewards for continuous participation in the ecosystem.Leverage the ColorTrace technology to attribute rewards directly proportional to the contribution towards USDV’s circulation and utility.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy.Success will be measured using the following KPIs:Growth in Liquidity: Measured by the TVL in key USDV pools on Arbitrum-based DEXes.User Base Expansion: Increase in active wallet addresses holding or transacting with USDV.Adoption Rate: Usage metrics of USDV in new payment use cases developed with Fiat24 and MugglePay.Community Engagement: Participation rates in marketing and community events.These KPIs indicate the grant’s success by directly measuring the liquidity, adoption, and engagement objectives set forth.Grant Timeline and Milestones:Q1-Q2: Focus on liquidity incentives and initial marketing campaigns.KPI: USDV reaches $10M. TraderJoe and Camelot live. Radiant live.Q3: Launch of new payment use cases with Fiat24 and MugglePay. Mid-point KPI: Implementation of at least two new use cases and a 10% increase in transaction volume.KPI: $15M TVLQ4: Evaluation and expansion of successful strategies, additional ecosystem grants.

This framework will provide a clear and structured path for individuals to get involved and contribute, ultimately enhancing the ecosystem and alleviating the workload on existing delegates.Members:@ocandocrypto - Angela O@san - Sandra CTeam Lead contact name: Angela OTelegram/Forum: @ocandocryptoPitchimage2928×1520 176 KBClick here to access to the presentationProposalAbstractThis proposal aims to create and manage a comprehensive onboarding framework for contributors, delegates, and builders in the Arbitrum DAO. The goal is to provide a clear, structured path for individuals to get involved, contribute, and enhance the ecosystem, while reducing the workload on current delegates.MotivationThe lack of a clear onboarding process for new contributors, delegates, and grantees is a significant barrier to their participation in the Arbitrum DAO. Establishing a structured framework will guide individuals to effectively engage with the community, driving innovation and growth within the ecosystem. The framework targets three main contributor types:Contributors: Focus on creating proposals to enhance the Arbitrum DAO, improving their ability to make impactful contributions.Grantees: Facilitate understanding of available grants and help identify suitable options for funding projects.Governance Analysts: Mentor individuals interested in DAO governance, fostering a skilled talent pool for delegate roles and protocol workflows.Optimizing DAO resources and operational efficiency, his framework minimizes delegates time spent in answering questions from new members, enhances proposal quality, and cultivates a talent funnel that encourages active participation and growth within governance teams.These insights stem from active participation in the Arbitrum Onboarding Working Group, which includes representation from @ocandocrypto collaborating with Seed LATAM, L2 Beat, 404 DAO, and Web3 Citizen as a second step proposal for the first experimental one.RationaleEstablishing a structured onboarding framework is crucial for the Arbitrum DAO as it simplifies entry for new participants, easing the path to contribution for grantees, contributors, and governance analysts alike. This approach reduces barriers, enhances community engagement, and fosters a sense of shared purpose. By investing in this framework, we bolster the Arbitrum ecosystem’s inclusivity, innovation, and ability to attract and retain top talent in the web3 space.GoalsStreamline Onboarding for Contributors, Delegates, and Grantees: Develop a comprehensive onboarding framework that clearly outlines the steps for individuals to get involved in the Arbitrum DAO, whether they are looking to contribute to projects, seek grants, or participate in governance.Enhance Community Engagement and Knowledge Sharing: Create sessions focused on onboard each type of contributor, having sessions with experienced DAO members, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.Facilitate Access to Resources and Support: Create a centralized Resource Guide that offers comprehensive information, tutorials, and FAQs. This guide will be easily accessible to all newcomers upon their first visit to the forum.SpecificationsArbitrum DAO Onboarding FrameworkWeekly Onboarding Calls: The Onboarding Working Group will continue hosting a weekly Arbitrum DAO Onboarding Call, where attendees will share their background and motivations to become part of the Arbitrum DAO. The Onboarding Working Group will share the different options to get involved in the DAO (as contributor, grantee and/or governance) and share that there will be a monthly call focused on each group.Reach out to new members to invite them to Focused Monthly Calls: The Onboarding Framework team will reach out to the new members to remind them to attend the Focused Monthly Call that they could be more interested about.Focused Monthly Calls: These calls will share everything each type of contributor should know for the next steps in their Arbitrum DAO contribution path. Each call will have different content and Q&A time:Grantees: The session will be “Grants 101” where attendees get to know the current grants they could apply for like Arbitrum Grants (Questbook, Foundation, Thrive, DAO), Arbitrum Funding Programs (GCP, etc.), also they will get an Arbitrum Grants Leader Directory and Application Templates.Contributors and Governance Analysts: They will have a session called “DAO 101” to explain the current initiatives in the DAO, main leaders, DAO resources and Calendar, how to use the forum and how to write a proposal. This session serves as a filter, participants interested in creating proposals will go to the Fellowships Incubators and the ones interested in becoming part of Arbitrum Governance will go to the Governance Analyst Incubator.Incubators for Contributors and Governance Analysts: 1 month of duration incubators that will accelerate the onboarding of Contributors and Governance Analysts from 0 to bring value to the Arbitrum DAO. Each one will be focused in a different result:Contributors: They will have a “Fellowship Incubator”, people with similar background will be put together in a group focused on DevRel, Operations, Social Media or Business Development, they will have weekly mentorship on how to write a proposal and the expected deliverable is the submission of a proposal to the Governance Forum.Governance Analysts: For contributors interested in governance, they will have a “Governance Analyst Incubator” where they will learn how to become delegates, learn the daily governance workflow, how to analyze a proposal and vote for it. They will receive weekly mentorship from experienced delegates on how the Arbitrum DAO governance works, the expected deliverable from this Incubator is to analyze proposals and post feedback weekly.Follow up Incubators results:Fellowship Incubator: Measure how many proposals were submitted and the feedback they got from delegates.Governance Analyst Incubator: Measure how much feedback was submitted from the participants to DAO proposals.Context Scaling: 5 participants of the Governance Analyst Incubator that were committed to submit feedback to proposals will be part of two extra months for this incubator, it is focused on match talented onboarded members with delegates that may not have enough time or tools to be updated to DAO proposals and they will support each other as the delegates get help and the newly Governance Analyst get experience from doing tasks l like analyze proposals weekly and give feedback to the DAO.Create a Talent Incubator: outstanding participants from both Incubators will be added to a Talent pool to be shared with Arbitrum DAO community so delegates or protocols can reach them and hire them if they are in need of their expertise.Steps to

Any details relating to past projects, recent achievements and any past experience utilizing incentives. Additionally, please provide further details on the state of your product, audience segments, and how you expect incentives to impact the product’s long-term growth and sustainability.Team experience (Any relevant experience that may be useful in evaluating ability to ship, or execution with grant incentives. Please provide references knowledgeable about past work, where relevant. If you wish to do so privately, indicate that. [Optional, but recommended]):Kain Warwick founded Synthetix, originally as Havven in 2017. The protocol has progressively decentralized over the years, and now features four main councils to steward the protocol. This includes the Spartan, Treasury, Grants, and Ambassador Councils. These councils work alongside the Core Contributors, who help to enact proposals and variable changes through SIPs and SCCPs to add additional features and manage the protocol.The Synthetix Protocol includes core contributors who are all longtime DeFi users, developers, product designers, etc. Many of our contributors have been involved in DeFi/Crypto since its early stages. We are happy to share additional information with the council privately.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?Synthetix introduces Synthetix V3 and Synthetix Perps to Arbitrum. Synthetix V3 marks a significant advancement in DeFi, enabling developers to create on-chain derivative applications using Synthetix’s liquidity and infrastructure permissionlessly. This innovation aims to expand the DeFi ecosystem by facilitating the development of diverse derivative products.Synthetix Perps, the primary application utilizing Synthetix liquidity, has facilitated over $45 billion in trading volume, distributing $35 million in fees to liquidity providers. Synthetix has also led the way in DEX Perps innovations, creating the standard for using Pyth off-chain oracles to decrease trading fees and the potential for frontrunning attacks while still maintaining decentralized trade execution. Alongside this, risk management innovations such as dynamic funding rates and price impact (simulated orderbooks) were created by Synthetix core contributors to ensure delta neutrality for perps LP’s. Both of these innovations are now commonplace across the DEX Perps industry, and shows how Synthetix is an innovator in the DeFi DEX Perps space.DeFi perps trading is larger on Arbitrum, and the natural destination for Synthetix as the real innovator of decentralized perps infrastructure and features. Arbitrum is where we all have the best chance for true defi to attract traders from centralized exchanges and traditional finance. Its time to put aside tribalism so defi has the best chance of dominance.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:Yes, Synthetix V3 serves as a foundational liquidity layer, enabling the creation and integration of various derivative products. It allows for the establishment of permissionless pools, acting as collateral and liquidity sources, which can be leveraged by other protocols on Arbitrum to create derivative markets. This functionality not only facilitates the launch of new derivative protocols but also ensures seamless integration with Synthetix Perps.We anticipate collaborations with existing partners and new ones such as Kwenta, Polynomial, Infinex, Rage trade, and others, leveraging Synthetix Perps liquidity to enhance perps trading activity on Arbitrum.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?In the context of Synthetix Perps:GMXVertexGains TradeRegarding Synthetix V3:PerennialHow do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs)Relevant usage metrics - Please refer to the OBL relevant metrics chart. For your category (DEX, lending, gaming, etc) please provide a list of all respective metrics as well as all metrics in the general section:Synthetix measures retention through key metrics aimed at tracking trading behavior, market behavior, long-term LP stickiness, and economic value created for Arbitrum. With this in mind, the main objective of Synthetix & Synthetix Perps is to transition users from CEX derivatives to DEX derivatives.Synthetix ran a trading rebate campaign in 2023 for traders of Synthetix perps and saw $155M in average daily volume during the incentive period, while maintaining $151M in daily volume in the period after incentives completed, retaining ~97% of daily volume with no incentives as of mid January 2024.https://dune.com/queries/3070613/5114546Council Q&A for this sectiona) How much was the volume prior to the campaign?Before the incentives kicked off (Dec 22, 2022 - Apr 19, 2023), Synthetix had established a daily trading volume of $35.5 million. It’s critical to put this into perspective though, the initial release of Synthetix Perps V2, completed on Dec 22nd, had supported a limited number of markets and OI caps, and had been scaled up during this time. However, the ETH and BTC markets were live during the pre-campaign period and have since maintained their status as the primary drivers of volume for the protocol despite nearly 80 additional perps markets going live since.Post-Incentives campaign, daily volume has shifted with the market and other competitor campaigns. Synthetix experienced several weeks of volume averages below the campaign period but also over 100% above pre-campaign averages. Recent weeks have far exceeded the incentivized volume period. As of this statement, the rolling 7 day volume average has been above $250M, nearly 70% higher than the volume during our incentives campaign.https://dune.com/queries/3070613/5114546b) How many funds were allocated to the commercial refund? Were they own funds or an initiative subsidized by an external party? (Grant from Optimism for example)The total amount of incentives distributed from the Phase 0 Optimism distribution was ~5.9m OP in trading incentives over a period. The average price of OP during this time was $1.48, so this makes the entire incentive program worth approx $8.73m.c) Do you have any dune that could accompany this statement?Yes, a community member made a Dune that includes the incentivized periods. https://dune.com/westie/synthetix-incentivesd) Based on the state of the market, how do you think this same campaign can play out at this time, on Arbitrum?Given the current market dynamics, increased engagement with o-chain derivatives, and the technological advancements since our last campaign, we expect a similar outcome.Users are likely to be attracted by LP and trading incentives to explore Synthetix. We believe they will remain engaged long-term upon using Synthetix LP & Synthetix Perps, particularly because of its innovative features such as the delta neutral LP experience using ETH/USDC collateral. This approach enables users to leverage their LP exposure more safely with the Arbitrum native stablecoin. We plan to rapidly increase LP collateral and stablecoin liquidity on Arbitrum in the first two months, positioning Synthetix to attract traders and encourage protocol use.The metrics that Synthetix primarily looks at are centered on a few main areas:Trading FeesTrading VolumeOpen InterestUnique Addresses TradingPerps Integrators & Volume/Fees generated by eachSequencer Fees GeneratedDevelopers building on Synthetix V3 and Perps V3Alongside OBL relevant metrics via Arbitrum Grants for each supported market (overlap expected)TVL: A daily time series expressed in USD.Trading Volume: A daily time series, also measured in USD.Open Interest: A daily time series measured in USD.List of Traders: A comprehensive record of individuals or entities that have engaged in trading activities. This list should include trader addresses and the volume of trades executed.List of Liquidity Providers: A list of current and past participants who have provided liquidity during the incentivized period of the protocol. The list should include LP addresses, their current liquidity in USD, time-weighted liquidity in USD, and the duration of liquidity provision.Trader Net P&L Improvement: The change in traders’ profit and loss accounts, reflecting on the platform’s fairness and attractiveness to traders.Funding Rate Stability: Tracks the fluctuations in the funding rates, assessing the balance between long and short positions and market sentiment.Liquidations: A daily time series measured in USD.Do you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan: Yes.Did you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal? If so, please disclose the details of that arrangement here, including conflicts of interest (Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant): No.SECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?: No, Synthetix initially launched on Ethereum Mainnet and later expanded to Optimism and Base.On what other networks is the protocol deployed?: Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, and Base.What date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?: Synthetix was deployed to Arbitrum on March 15th 2024.Do you have a native token?: Yes, the native token is $SNXGovernance: SNX holders can participate in Synthetix governance by electing council members.Fee Share: With the introduction of other collateral types like USDC on Base, a portion of the fees from these will be used to buy back and either burn or distribute $SNX to stakers.Past Incentivization: What liquidity mining/incentive programs, if any, have you previously run? Please share results and dashboards, as applicable?Synthetix participated in the Optimism Phase 0 Distribution, distributing OP to Synthetix Perps traders, sUSD liquidity providers, and bridge users. For detailed results, a retrospective can be provided to the council.Current Incentivization: How are you currently incentivizing your protocol?Currently, Synthetix does not offer incentives to perps traders, with only minimal incentives on Velodrome for sUSD liquidity on Optimism.Have you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem related program?No.Protocol Performance:Total Value Locked (TVL): Synthetix has a TVL of $678 million, distributed as $257 million on Optimism and $435 million on Ethereum Mainnet.(Source: DeFiLlama)Total Perps Volume: The platform has surpassed $45 billion in total perpetual trade volume.(Source: Internal SNX Data - can share link with council)Unique Perps Traders: Over 60,000 traders have traded on Synthetix Perps.(Source: SNX Community Dune Analytics)Total Perps Trades: There have been over 760,000 cumulative trades(Source: SNX Community Dune Analytics)Total Perps Fees Generated: Fees generated from perpetual trades exceed $35 million.(Source: Internal SNX Data - can share with council)Total Sequencer Revenue: The revenue to the Optimism sequencer amounts to 915 ETH, approximately $2,516,250.(Source: SNX Community Dune Analytics)Protocol Roadmap:* Spartan Council approval for initial Arbitrum deployment specification* Write & Audit Arbitrum Gas Oracle Adapter smart contract* Deploy on Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet* Risk analysis of Arbitrum Specific Implementation vs Current Deployment* Release Synthetix V3 Core System & Perps v3 on Arbitrum Mainnet on March 15thProgressive ramp up of V3 liquidity and then open interestPerps V3 UX ImprovementsSupport for existing perps markets on Optimism/BaseSupport for a yield generating collateral type to amplify Perps Fee yieldCore System Upgrades will be delivered to Arbitrum as developedCollaborate with ecosystem partners and integrators on ArbitrumGovernance will help to guide the long-term vision of the Synthetix protocol and introduce relevant products to the ecosystem to support its long term growth and etcAudit History & Security Vendors: Permanent engagement with Iosiro for all code released, as well as one off audits for major releases from Open Zeppelin.Security Incidents: No. Synthetix has not had any security incidents.SECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONDetail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.Requested Grant Size: 4,500,000 ARBJustification for the size of the grant: The grant is aimed at bootstrapping liquidity for Synthetix derivative markets on Arbitrum through LP incentives, fee rebates,trading competitions, growth experiments to engage users, and supporting a decentralized Synthetix stablecoin on Arbitrum.This request is based on the significant potential to shift substantial trading volume and TVL from centralized to decentralized platforms, as perps protocols have proven their product market fit among traders and users.Grant Matching: Synthetix Treasury Council has a strong history of incentivizing liquidity and trading, and will do so on Arbitrum. In addition to specific SNX Arbitrum incentives that will be disclosed soon, there are existing SNX incentives that will apply to Arbitrum, such as STP-10.Grant Breakdown:1,600,000 ARB for LP incentives.1,800,000 ARB for trading fee rebates.500,000 ARB for Stablecoin liquidity.600,000 ARB for trading competitions and other growth experimentsFunding Address (Treasury multisig on Arb): 0xf0288B07A9B9a49dbf9a2f584DB371093E8C14E2Funding Address Characteristics: 3 of 4 multisig, members elected by token holders.Treasury Address on L1: 0x99f4176ee457afedffcb1839c7ab7a030a5e4a92Contract Address: 0x4Ab09F627fa9706f33178129005300Fd4c00EDF1SECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESClearly outline the primary objectives of the program and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), execution strategy, and milestones used to measure success. This helps reviewers understand what the program aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.Objectives:The grant aims to use ARB incentives to kickstart deployment of the Synthetix protocol on Arbitrum and bring Synthetix’s innovative derivatives liquidity platform to Arbitrum users. Synthetix has a strong history of carefully using incentives to build momentum for great products, which carries on long after incentives have ended.Execution Strategy: [Describe the plan for executing including token distribution method (e.g. farming, staking, bonds, referral program, etc), what you are incentivizing, resources, products, use of funds, and risk management. This includes allocations for specific pools, eligible assets, products, etc.]Allocation of ARB Incentives:1,600,000 ARB allocated for Perps V3 LP incentives to attract a critical mass of LP collateral and offer competitive perps liquidity. These LP incentives will be the primary focus of the first month, but distributed over months 1 and 2. These aim to establish and continue a solid foundation for liquidity of ARB, ETH, USDC and DAI as collateral for Synthetix Perps.500,000 ARB for stablecoin pool Incentives: These incentives aim to support liquidity for an Arbitrum native Synthetix-powered stablecoin (sUSD) that LPs will be able to borrow against liquidity positions.The most likely pairs to incentivize will be sUSD/USDC and sUSDC/DAI - which allows LPs to increase their capital efficiency of LPing to SynthetixThese LP incentives are critical to increasing the system’s capital efficiency. LPs can mint sUSD against their ETH/USDC/DAI/ARB collateral delegated to Perps V3 on Arbitrum, allowing users to swap this sUSD into USDC/ETH/DAI/ARB and LP into the system again. Using this newly minted sUSD, users can leverage their LP exposure while maintaining the same delta neutrality the Perps V3 system is known for. Wrappers will be used for maintaining peg, as well proven on other chains.1,800,000 ARB for trading rewards: This allocation is aimed at acquiring new users with rebates for both gas and exchange fees. These incentives will be capped at 100% of fees traded by each trader, so there will be no possibility to sybil. Trading rewards will be utilized and the focus of the 3rd and final month following distribution. Synthetix has a track recording of building the best onchain perps, and effectively using incentives to gain traction, after which volume and activity is largely retained.600,000 ARB for Trading Competitions and other growth experiments: Trading competitions will be held to attract new users and increase trading volume. The ARB allocated will be distributed as prizes over several competitions throughout the 2nd and 3rd month, with a focus on maximizing engagement and bringing in new traders.Growth Experiments: These include gas fee rebates, trading competitions, cross-synergies between Arbitrum protocols, and incentives that will bring users from other chains, such as utilizing ARB incentives to rebate trading fees/gas fees/competitions for partner protocols, like Pyth Network on Solana alongside those building alongside/atop Synthetix on Arbitrum. We see this as a very supportive way to bring users from other chains to Arbitrum and keep them engaged with our Arbitrum specific ecosystem.Incentives Distribution Timeline: All incentive programs will be concluded following 3 months after distribution. Synthetix will begin with LP incentives for the first month, stablecoin liquidity incentives in the second month, and trading & growth experiment incentives in the third and final month.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric? [Provide relevant design and implementation details]To enhance stickiness of capital / trading activity and ensure sustained engagement with Synthetix on Arbitrum, our incentive design includes multiple strategies:Initial Engagement through Liquidity Incentives and Trading Rebates: Initially, incentives will be used to seed a critical mass of LP TVL which, combined with trading rebates and Synthetix’s best-in-class trade execution, will be extremely attractive to early users.Streaming ARB Rewards: We’ll distribute rewards for trading and liquidity provision over time. This approach encourages ongoing participation and engagement with the platform.Emphasis on Continuous Product Innovation: As we plan for a future reduction in direct incentives, our focus will shift to retaining users through continuous innovation and the introduction of new features which will expand the product offering, reduce fees, and keep users within the Synthetix Ecosystem. Some of these new features include, but are not limited to, support for yield-generating assets to reduce the need for LP incentives, alongside yield-generating perp margin, auto-LP leverage looping tools, decreased perp trading fees following Pyth Oracle innovations, and more.Involvement in Governance: Engaging users in governance decisions aims to foster a deeper connection to the platform, encouraging long-term engagement. Synthetix has one of the most well-rounded and engaged governance systems in all of DeFi, and we expect to onboard many new users indirectly through ARB rewards. While rewards will not be utilized to incentivize governance activity, Synthetix will market community-run campaigns to support new perps assets, increase OI caps, and add yield-generating native perp margin/LP collateral native to arbitrum. All of these are vital areas that governance must debate and work through with the support of new Arbitrum users.As Synthetix has successfully demonstrated on other chains, wrappers can be used to maintain the peg of the sUSD stablecoin on >$100m market cap across two chains.These strategies are designed to draw users initially with trading incentives and then retain them through platform improvements, rewards for continued participation, and governance involvement. Our aim is to cultivate a dedicated trading community on Arbitrum, with a future focus on reducing reliance on direct financial incentives to ensure a sustainable deployment.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy. [Please also justify why these specific KPIs will indicate that the grant has met its objective. Distribution of the grant itself should not be one of the KPIs.]To effectively measure the success of the grant objectives, we will track the following KPIs during the 3-month incentive period:Perps Trading Volume: Monitor the weekly/ monthly increase in trading volume to track active trader engagement and usage of incentives.Fee Growth: Assess the monthly growth in trading fees generated, this will also help to support continued LP interest in supporting Perps V3.Total LP TVL: Measure the total value of liquidity provider collateral backing the markets. Increases here will allow for deeper OI support for markets, and long-tail market support.Unique Addresses: Count the number of unique wallet addresses engaging with the platform, reflecting ‘unique’ user adoption.Open Interest for Individual Markets: Track the open interest across different markets to gauge long-term market interest.Open Interest for ETH/BTC and Long-tail Markets: Special focus on open interest in major and niche markets to understand trader distribution across supported markets.Number of Markets Supported: Regularly track the total number of supported markets, with an expectation that continued support for new long-tail markets will help to bring in new traders.Grant Timeline and Milestones: [Describe the timeline for the grant, including ideal milestones with respective KPIs. Include at least one milestone that shows progress en route to a final outcome. Please justify the feasibility of these milestones.]Week 1-4: Establish LP baseBegin distributing ARB incentives focusing on initial LP incentives to scale collateral on ArbitrumMilestone: Reach 50m in LP collateral across ARB, DAI, USDC, ETH, and any other supported collateral types.KPI to Watch: Initial increase in LP collateral, initial perp markets launched.Week 4-8: Scale Open InterestMilestone: Reach 20m in liquidity Stablecoin liquidity on key pairs like sUSD/USDC and sUSDC/DAI Milestone: Support primary perp markets and begin to allocate OI to these markets to scale up trading activity for week 8-12KPIs to Watch: Stablecoin liquidity, LP collateral, # of supported markets, OI limit for supported markets.Week 8-12: Scale Perp Volume and User OnboardingMilestone: Achieve 10b in cumulative trading volume, and add longer tail perp marketsMilestone: Onboard 10,000 unique trading addresses.KPIs to Watch: Cumulative trading volume and unique trading addresses.Week 12 onwards: Self-sustaining volume and growthMilestone: Onboard a native yield-generating collateral type. Continued tracking for trading volume growth, open interest, and number of markets.KPIs to Watch: Number of markets supported, trading volume and open interest.How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem? [Clearly explain how the inputs of your program justify the expected benefits to the DAO. Be very clear and tangible, and you must back up your claims with data]Receiving this grant will significantly impact the Arbitrum ecosystem by driving growth and fostering innovation in several ways:Increased Trading Activity: The incentive program is expected to boost trading volume on Arbitrum, further increasing the trading activity on Arbitrum. This will help to ensure Arbitrum is a competitive DeFi ecosystem.Liquidity and Market Depth: By incentivizing liquidity providers, the grant will ensure deep liquidity for Synthetix markets on Arbitrum. This makes the protocol more attractive for perps traders, helping to improve the trader experienceUser Adoption: With targeted incentives for new and existing users, the program aims to significantly increase the number of users interacting with Synthetix and Arbitrum.Experimentation and Innovation: Synthetix will also work to enable the new perps markets and collateral types, including yield-generating collateral assets.This can include, but is not limited to sDAI, sUSDe, etherfi eth, wsteth, etc.Ecosystem Synergies: The growth of Synthetix on Arbitrum will have spillover effects on other protocols within the ecosystem, driving overall growth. Increased activity on Synthetix can lead to higher demand for Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem, fostering development of composable protocols atop Synthetix liquidity and infrastructure.Synthetix Support for Arbitrum: By deploying on Arbitrum, Synthetix, a well-established protocol in DeFi, directly encourages its existing user base to try out its Arbitrum deployment. Many Synthetix users have shown interest in Arbitrum, and this move signals a strategic expansion that meets user demand.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?

At no point would they be stuck or confused, with ample help provided along the way.Users are met with a “sign in/up” screen instead of “create wallet.” Selecting it will give them the option to select a “social login.” This is powered by Web3auth, which creates a wallet for them and ties it to their social network. It is fully non-custodial since neither we nor web3auth has access to any of their funds, and they can easily export their private key at any time.image591×1280 90.6 KBOnce the sign up is completed, the user will see a prompt for them to buy to fund their account and a tutorial video on how to get started.image591×1280 94.5 KBWe have multiple simplified KYC gateway options that buy Arbitrum USDC directly onto the platform, which can be used to deposit into all in-app vaults.image591×1280 85.1 KBOnce they fund their account, users can go to the earn page to see auto-compounding vaults. Single-sided vaults are emphasized as they are both easy to understand and have no impermanent loss. Common dual-token vaults are also available below for those who prefer.image591×1280 79.8 KBThe users can easily deposit by just tapping the vault they want, typing in their desired value (or tap “max”) and then deposit, with a confirmation appearing in seconds. The withdrawal is also just as easy. For social wallets, gas is paid via a backend that supplies just-in-time gas. We are aiming to upgrade to EIP-4337 to make the gas payments decentralized in the future.image591×1280 82.2 KBThe user is now earning in an auto-compounded vault, meaning they also will not have to swap reward tokens into anything else, completing the “one token” abstraction.

We have previously worked together on other projects and we’re active contributors in multiple DAOs. Since our audit completion in mid-February, Contrax has begun integrations with several other projects building on Arbitrum, to help grow the ecosystem and provide their communities with a simplified alternative for on-boarding liquidity.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?No other auto-compounder on any chain has abstracted away the difficulties that prevent non-DeFi natives from being users. Contrax has introduced social logins, gas coverage, default-zapping for all vaults, and a simplified UX, opening the doors of DeFi to the masses. The target users of Contrax are not current users of Arbitrum products, but rather, those that may struggle to understand or use any L2. On Contrax, users can fund their account with Arbitrum USDC on-ramps, then just deposit, without needing to think about bridging or asset-types.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:Yes! Contrax is built atop a variety of protocols on the Arbitrum One network including Hop, GMX, Plutus and Sushi. Contrax has agreements to integrate, and then partner with, the followingSavvy Defi ($500k TVL): Savvy relies on auto-compounding vaults to hold the collateral deposits of their users and is integrating Contrax’s vaults to have their users earn auto-compounding yield.PeaPods Finance ($34m TVL): PeaPods have many single-sided yield opportunities. Contrax will bring less-DeFi comfortable users, as well as those just seeking a more automated UX, to Peapods’s pods.Steer Protocol ($18m TVL): Contrax will bring Steer’s upcoming single-sided smart pools to Contrax, opening up a new category of users for them. This partnership was requested by Sushi, which has agreed to help boost the exposure of this integration when completed.Origin Protocol ($208m TVL): Contrax will bring in OETH and OUSD to Contrax, providing yet another single sided  yield opportunity to its users that bears yield. This introduction was also by Sushi, who have agreed to amplify the outcome post-integration.Since integrations are much more in our control than TVL, Contrax is willing to commit to these integrations as part of the milestones roadmap.Contrax is also currently working with Sushi to find further applications of our platform’s USP for other Arbitrum projects. As a project, Contrax aims to be a corridor between DeFi non-natives and existing DeFi projects on Arbitrum.Contrax is committing to these integrations as part of its application for the LTIPP.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?Yes. Beefy & Yearn also provide yield aggregation and auto-compounding, but their products are more complex and thus built for a different end user than Contrax. We’re building a simpler experience (through account abstraction) for users who are currently overwhelmed with anything more than a CEX.Contrax is also not confined to auto-compounders. Any type of DeFi product where users input tokens for yield-bearing opportunitiesHow do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs)As a DeFi platform that earns its revenue from deposits, total platform TVL is of course our main metric, followed by users, and TVL per vault, along with time in vault for users. We are currently upgrading our metric tracking to also include lost APY changes from Contrax-offered vaults, and slippage fees paid for zaps. Our goal is to use these metrics to find the weaknesses in our product while also spotting opportunities based on user trends.Retention for us is retaining TVL in our vaults. We are setting up our metrics to distinguish between retained TVL and new TVL, so that we understand 1.5m differently if it is the same deposits as the previous day vs. $1.5m where 500k was lost from previous users and replaced by newer onesRelevant usage metrics -Daily active usersDaily active growthDaily transaction countDaily protocol feeDaily transaction feeDaily ARB expenditure and user claimsIncentivized user list and gini coefficientPlatform TVLTVL for each vaultDo you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan:YesDid you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal?

Contrax was launched for testing a closed community from January 1st, 2023.This is the earliest contract we have deployed from our records: StrategySushiWethDai | Address 0x1AAD889B2bF25926fC76e79250674F33AEe5E5bC | ArbiscanIt was deployed on 2022-08-18 19:02:00Do you have a native token?No, but we have a temporary non-transferable token that is just limited in purpose to voting. The temporary token is xTRAX. xTRAX tokens will mark users for the airdrop of the TRAX token, scheduled to be Q3 of this year.We also have tokenomics for the TRAX token that has passed the DAO vote and are planned to be implemented by token launch.Past Incentivization: What liquidity mining/incentive programs, if any, have you previously run? Please share results and dashboards, as applicable?We are just launched so we have not run any programs just yet.Current Incentivization: How are you currently incentivizing your protocol?Contrax is building up toward an eventual airdrop to the holders of xTRAX and those that complete airdrop quests, and DAO tasks on Notion. We ran our first Intract campaign recently which ended on March 13th, and plan to hold campaigns there again along with Guild and Galxe ones. Contrax will create a public “points board” to display the points per wallet. Points will play a role in the Contrax airdrop as well.On the Contrax platform, stakers earn xTRAX tokens for staking at the distribution rate of 0.002 TRAX per $1 per 1% per day.Have you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem related program?No.Protocol Performance:Our protocol began advertising with the launch of the Intract campaign a week ago. Our current TVL is at about $20,000 (March 17th). The live TVL can be seen on DeFi Llama.For users, Contrax is currently 100 users, with about 50 of those users staking in the past two weeks. We were the 4th fastest growing protocol on Arbitrum last week due to our first Intract campaign.Here is a chart pulling the data of our top 5 vaults. The deposits are mainly in our single sided vaults, validating that these are the vaults to focus on for our target users.RankVaultDeposited TVLAverage DepositsNumber of Deposits1ETH$19,475$314632USDC$1,344$56343WETH-MAGIC$99216564USDT$67451135WETH-DAI$350705We want to emphasize that our audit completed mid-February and our go-to-market with our majority integrations seeking to bring in our target TVL will be in early Q2, the same time as the grant release. Our current TVL is mainly friends, family, and some participants from our first Intract campaign to begin our attempt to spread the word of the live dApp to potential users. Although we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from users and other projects alike, we are still relatively small and unknown right now, and hope to change that upcoming integration and co-marketing partnerships.Protocol Roadmap:These are the milestones Contrax is aiming to achieve this year:MarchAirdrop campaign will continue on multiple airdrop platformsIntegrate Savvy so that users loaned on Savvy can deposit on Contrax.Integrate PeaPods so that users can autocompound their Pod assets.Q2 2023Integrate Steer ProtocolIntegrate Origin FinanceToken-based seed roundEIP-4337 upgrade to decentralize our gas coverageQ3 2023Continue DeFi project integrationsTRAX token airdrop to stakers, questers, & DAO contributorsDAO Treasury will release its first batch of TRAX to allocate.Upgrade xTRAX to vTRAX that will be redeemable for TRAX post-lockup.Q4 2023Continue DeFi project integrationsUpgrade to ERC-4626 Upgrade to allow for more efficient auto compounding.Launch IOS & Android Apps to widen the reach of Contrax users.Contrax is also in the process of applying with accelerators that have shown interest with the following: Sushi, Accelerator DAO (HyperNest), and Orange DAO.Audit History & Security Vendors:Contrax has been listed with Immunefi since last year. We have kept our contracts up to date. We have also recently completed our security audit with Cyberscope. We have also run Consensys diligence fuzzing to run automated tests of known exploits on our contracts.Security Incidents:None.SECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONRequested Grant Size:39,000 ARB with strict milestone-based claw back conditionsJustification for the size of the grant 27:Contrax is newly launched, and also fully bootstrapped. Our current TVL of about $20k is not reflective of our product at all, since it is mainly friends and family depositors before our go-to-market. We are basically pre-TVL and have yet to actually start executing on our go-to-market plan of integrating DeFi partners (Savvy, PeaPods, Steer, and Origin), which will bring TVL by simplifying UX for their users.In our projections, we believe Contrax will start at about $50,000 in TVL when the grant program begins, and we assume an aggressive 44% week over week growth scenario as we are acquiring our first users via our airdrop token and hopefully LTIPP incentives as well. However, this growth rate does not need to be believed by the council given our clawback conditions. If Contrax hits at least the 44% WoW milestone every week, then it can emit the full amount of ARB in the period. Otherwise, it can only emit proportional to the target milestone (example: 90% of the target would allow for 90% of the period’s ARB to be emitted).In terms of the benefits for Arbitrum: Contrax is exclusively on Arbitrum and does not intend to ever bring a fractured chain experience on our platform, as it would confuse and drive away our target audience. In the short term, we are against chain expansion, as the idea of chain-specific farming goes against the simplified UX-centric nature of our platform. In the future, Contrax may work with other chains on the strict condition that these chains are abstracted away in a non-custodial manner.As a product for onboarding, Contrax would also serve a pipeline for non-DeFi native users to be onboarded to Arbitrum. As a product, Contrax builds atop of existing DeFi infrastructure on Arbitrum, and our value proposition is ease of access and understanding of these currently-inaccessible products.This grant will not only catalyze Contrax Finance’s growth but also contribute significantly to the Arbitrum ecosystem by attracting new users, retaining them through innovative services, and generating revenue that sustains these growth initiatives. By targeting liquidity, volume, and user engagement, we aim to establish a virtuous cycle of growth benefiting both Contrax Finance and the broader Arbitrum community.Grant Matching:Contrax is not in a position to commit to any definitive match, but is committed to also emit its own DAO token (xTRAX pre-airdrop, TRAX post-airdrop) to all vaults during the entirety of the LTIPP program.Important note: xTRAX does not yet have a price, so it is not included in the TVL or the APY for Contrax now, nor will it be for any point during the LTIPP period.Grant Breakdown:24,500 ARB for increased APR via auto-compounding.8,000 ARB for loyalty rewards that will also allow users to become participants in the Arbitrum DAO.6,500 ARB for gas coverage of social wallets.Details on executing for each one are in the strategy section.Funding Address:0xCb410A689A03E06de0a6247b13C13D14237DecC8Funding Address Characteristics:The multisig must be able to accept and interact with ERC-721s in order to accept the funding stream.

Increasing APRs (24,500 ARB)This portion of the grant will be used to provide Contrax vaults a competitive APY with auto-compounding and adding liquidity to the underlying Arbitrum-based protocols our vaults built on top of (currently Hop, GMX, Sushi, and Plutus). Our proposal has been designed with the target increase of ~52% APR (or slightly higher as an APY due to our auto-compounding, but disregarded as is only for a 12 weeks) during the incentive period. If we use our current metrics of the a average user depositing $200 in TVL, our emission target would translate to about 2 ARB per user period. (If our actual TVL-per-user is much higher, it doesn’t matter, as it does not affect our emission calculations.)Here is our proposed auto-compounding emissions chart with milestones baked in.Growth Scenario: 44% WoW Growth2-Week PeriodStart TVL AssumptionUser CountARB to be emittedMax ARB AllowedAs a %Cumulative ARB EmittedARB Emitted Per UserAPR Boost to all Vaults1$50,000250500500100.00%5002.0052.00%2$94,000470950950100.00%1,4502.0252.55%3$176,72088413501350100.00%2,8002.0052.00%4$332,2341,66135003500100.00%6,3002.1154.78%5$624,5993,12362006200100.00%12,5001.9951.62%6$1,174,2465,8711200012000100.00%24,5002.0453.14%Here is a definition of each column for full clarity:ColumnExplanation2-Week PeriodThe start of each 2 week period of the LTIPP grant program.Start TVL AssumptionThe ARB emitted is dependent on the TVL. In the above model, we start at 50,000 and assume a 44% WoW growth to calculate each periodUser CountEvery $200 in TVL is counted as a user, based on our current metrics. Although the true value may vastly differ in the program, the milestones are TVL-based, so user-based data is purely illustrative.ARB to be emittedThis is the actual ARB that will be emitted based on the TVL. In this chart, we assume we hit our 44 WoW target, so we always emit the full bucket. Higher TVL would not emit more ARB, so the APR for all users will be lower.Max ARB AllowedGiven the grant request of 24,500 for this category, we have assigned maximum emissions for the period in line with the expected growth of the period.As a %The % of the allocated ARB that was emitted in this model.Cumulative ARB EmittedThis is just keeping track of the ARB emitted up to and including the period. The final period shows the full ARB to be emitted in this projection model.ARB Emitted Per UserAssuming a user as $200. Based on our set buckets, this is target to be around 2 ARB per user per period.As APR boost on all Vaults$2 ARB assumed. ARB emitted per user extrapolated as an APR using the TVL and ARB emitted values. Its not a true “APR” as it is for 3 months. It will actually be about 13% when the 0% ARB for the rest of the year is considered.Note that xTRAX is not calculated as part of the APR here or anywhere else. Also note that we preferred APR to APY in calculations as the period is not significant and the data becomes harder to read when APY is considered.Claw-back Explained with ScenariosThe emissions above are our target scenario, and represents the highest emissions possible at the lowest TVL. If all those TVL figures end up being double, then our APRs on all vaults will be half the stated values. However, the main concern the council may have is the scenarios where our TVL is much lower, a fair risk to be concerned about given that we are just starting our go-to-market. It is for this reason we are committing to only emitting the full ARB amount if all milestones leading to $1.17m TVL by the end of the program are met. Otherwise, emissions will be proportional to the TVL.To illustrate this, here are some TVL assumptions and how they would translate to our ARB emissions.Middle Scenario: 33% WoW growth2-Week PeriodStart TVL AssumptionUser CountARB to be emittedMax ARB AllowedAs a %Cumulative ARB EmittedARB Emitted Per UserAPR Boost to all Vaults1$50,000250500500100.00%5002.0052.00%2$83,00041583995088.30%1,3392.0252.55%3$137,7806891364175077.97%2,7031.9851.49%4$228,7151,1442409350068.84%5,1132.1154.78%5$379,6671,8983769620060.79%8,8811.9951.62%6$630,2473,15164411200053.67%15,3222.0453.14%Clawback:9,178In this scenario, we assume a 33% week over week growth instead of 44%, ending with $630k in TVL by the end of the program. We see that the APRs and ARB per user remain the same, as intended by this model. The ARB emitted, however, have been reduced for all periods after the first one.We can see the culalitive ARB emitted is 15,322, leading to a claw-back of 9,178 ARB (by subtracting 15,322 from the requested 24,500).Here, we present the scenario for a 22% WoW growth rate:Weak Growth Scenario: 22% Wow Growth2-Week PeriodStart TVL AssumptionUser CountARB to be emittedMax ARB AllowedAs a %Cumulative ARB EmittedARB Emitted Per UserAPR Boost to all Vaults1$50,000250500500100.00%5002.0052.00%2$72,00036072895076.60%1,2282.0252.55%3$103,6805181027175058.67%2,2541.9851.49%4$149,2997461573350044.94%3,8272.1154.78%5$214,9911,0752134620034.42%5,9611.9951.62%6$309,5871,54831641200026.36%9,1252.0453.14%Clawback:15,375Finally, to demonstrate the scenario of no growth throughout the entire program, almost the entire allocated ARB would be returned:No Growth Scenario2-Week PeriodStart TVL AssumptionUser CountARB to be emittedMax ARB AllowedAs a %Cumulative ARB EmittedARB Emitted Per UserAPR Boost to all Vaults1$50,000250500500100.00%5002.0052.00%2$50,00025050595053.19%1,0052.0252.55%3$50,000250495175028.29%1,5001.9851.49%4$50,000250527350015.05%2,0272.1154.78%5$50,00025049662008.01%2,5241.9951.62%6$50,000250511120004.26%3,0342.0453.14%Clawback:21,4662. Loyalty Rewards & DAO Education (8,000 ARB)This portion of the grant will give stakers who stay within their vaults a one-time payment in ARB at the end of the incentives period, and then direct them to become active in the Arbitrum DAO by adding the DAO’s Snapshot voting directly in the Contrax dApp (as we already do with our Snapshot). Users must stay within their vaults without exiting to be eligible for the ARB. Given our target of less crypto native users, this may be their first exposure to a DAO (other than Contrax itself), and be a gateway into becoming lifelong DAO members. Additionally, Contrax will also add a single sided ARB by this time so that users who want to earn a return from the ARB can easily do so.This model also has a claw back based on TVL mechanism built in. Simply put, if some or even most of the ARB is not earned by stakers, then it is returned.Earning ParametersUsers will earn at a set rate that is a factor of their TVL & time deposited.Each vault will have its own ARB amount earned. (However, given that earnings are based on deposit amount, a user will earn the same whether they have $1,000 in 1 vault, or $100 in ten vaults).For each vault, if the user withdraws, their ARB earned reset to 0.A user will only get ARB for the vaults they are in at the end of the LTIPP time frame.If all of the granted ARB to Contrax depletes, then no more ARB will be earned, but users must still remain in their vaults to actually receive their earned ARB at the end of the program.Users will be shown the ARB they have earned if they stay until the end of the program. If they withdraw, the ARB earned will reset to 0. Users must be deposited at the end of the LTIPP grant to receive their ARB. This will be clearly communicated to the participants. The tracking of ARB earned based on deposit size and time is not unlike how we currently track the xTRAX tokens to distribute to users based on time and size. Therefore, it will be relatively easy for us to implement this tracking.Earning RateThe earning rate for every user ($200 in TVL) will be 0.7 ARB per period. This rate is set and will not change no matter the user count. It will only go to zero if 8,000 ARB have been earned in total.To see this practically, lets look at how the ARB would be distributed in our target 44% WoW scenario (ignoring the 8k cap for this illustration):Earners by Week123456Earned Per Bucket1$50,000$50,000$50,000$50,000$50,000$50,0001,050.0020$44,000$44,000$44,000$44,000$44,000770.00300$82,720$82,720$82,720$82,7201,158.084000$155,514$155,514$155,5141,632.8950000$292,366$292,3662,046.56600000$549,6471,923.77Total TVL:$50,000$94,000$176,720$332,234$624,599$1,174,246ARB Earned1753296191,1632,1864,1108,581.30Note: we are assuming that new stakers all join at once at the start of a period, but in reality, they will join at any time, so there won’t really be “buckets” with clean cut-offs. This is for illustrative purposes.We see the ARB emitted as buckets per users that in come during each period. We see that the users from week 1 ($50,000 in TVL for 6 periods) earn just about half of what the $550k of new TVL earns in period 6 if there was no cap.This is now the actual distribution that would happen by with our 8,000 ARB available.Earners by Week123456Earned Per Bucket1$50,000$50,000$50,000$50,000$50,000$50,0001,050.0020$44,000$44,000$44,000$44,000$44,000770.00300$82,720$82,720$82,720$82,7201,158.084000$155,514$155,514$155,5141,632.8950000$292,366$292,3662,046.56600000$549,6471,342.47Total TVL:$50,000$94,000$176,720$332,234$624,599$1,174,246ARB Earned1753296191,1632,1863,5298,000Now, the latest bucket has significantly reduced rewards. harming the late earner’s emissions. If our TVL grows faster than expected, the rewards run out earlier and may not be available in later weeks.Claw back Condition: If we do not hit these TVL targets, then the emission formula not reach 8,000 ARB, since there will not be enough TVL to emit it at the set rate of 0.7 ARB per $200 per period. The rest of the ARB will be returned3. Gas Coverage for Social Wallets (6,500 ARB)This portion of the grant will allow us to continue to cover the gas costs paid for deposit and withdraws on social wallets. This is a better version of a gas rebate, since it is automatically paid at the time of the transaction and removes another friction point for the user, further encouraging on chain activity. Contrax provides just-in-time gas to cover transactions done by social wallets, so no ETH need be in the wallet before the transaction.Although Contrax already has been doing this in production for a while, it can become expensive, especially at scale and when gas costs are high. Because we have only just started our first funding round, we cannot guarantee the ability to cover this cost as transactions outpace our available funds. Halting gas coverage will also break the user’s account abstraction experience. Before each period, Contrax will swap the ARB to ETH and send it to our gas-funding wallet based on our expected growth, with the option to refill if it runs out before.As with the other strategies, Contrax will return all ARB not used, which would occur if the ARB amount is more than the social wallet transaction costs in the LTIPP period.Justification for requested amountThe request of 6,500 ARB is based off of our attempt to map the expected number of transactions on Contrax to the gas needed to cover them. Here are the factors we considered:Gas cost per deposit/withdraw: Historically, it has cost between $0.50 and $2.50 to cover the gas for all transactions to complete a deposit (or a withdraw). Gas costs have consistently increased, so most transactions recently cost more than $2. Therefore, we can assume that 1 ARB = one deposit or withdraw covered.Multiple deposits/withdraws per user: A user may experiment with different vaults, or decide to deposit into several vaults in Contrax (note: we cover up to six transactions a day). If we assume the average user may stick to only one vault (a deposit and a withdraw) but some others may do anywhere between 2 and 10. Assuming 4 deposit/withdrawal coverage per user is a reasonable assumption.Only social wallet coverage: Our go-to-market is attempting to make social wallets more popular. We can take up the assumption that most (70%) of users will be using social wallets.Definition of a user: We have defined a user to be $200 in TVL, but in reality, the average deposit will very likely increase. For this calculation, we can assume $500 in TVL is an average deposit, giving us 2,400 users in a success scenario.The estimated ARB needed for gas coverage: 2,400 users × 4 deposits/withdraws per user  × 0.7 being social wallet users  = 6,720 ARBOur request amount is slightly below this value. If the true value is higher, then we will commit to continue covering gas for the period of grant. If it is lower, as stated before, the unused amount will be returned in full.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric?We believe there is built-in stickiness to the ease-of-use portion of the product, in that, it may be the only DeFi auto-compounder our target user would be able to use. The APR increase incentives users to deposit, the gas coverage facilitates the deposits, and the ARB learned via loyalty would especially encourage users to keep providing the liquidity as there is a “penalty” in withdrawing in the form of not receiving any ARB accumulated.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy.Total Platform TVL - The TVL metric is more useful than user count, which can be Sybiled and doesn’t always reflect the value brought to the project or ecosystem. DeFillama will be our source of truth.Weekly Cumulative Vault Deposit - The WCVD metric will allow us to measure inflows of new capital. We can also view the deposits on a per vault basis to see which vaults out/underperform. The source of truth will be a subgraph pulling data from our smart contracts.Average Time-Staked - Tracking the amount of time that users remain staked, on average, before exiting a vault will allow us to track whether users are increasing their time staking or not. Knowing whether this value is increasing or decreasing will help us to better allocate our staking incentives. The source of truth will be a subgraph pulling data from our smart contracts.Grant Timeline and Milestones:We have provided charts to break down expectations period by period. Contrax commits to sharing any data requested related to the grant allocations and metrics that relate to the allocations.How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?Contrax’s meticulously planned approach is designed to benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem from multiple angles, showcasing a holistic project strategy that not only boosts current ecosystem metrics but also sets a foundation for perpetual onboarding and engagement within the Arbitrum DAO.Liquidity in DeFi Pools: Contrax will increase the liquidity of several pools on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Contrax is designed to bring in new users to DeFi, so we expect the liquidity brought in to be new liquidity that was not already elsewhere on Arbitrum.Retention Strategies for Sustained Engagement: With 8k ARB dedicated to loyalty rewards, we are now providing ARB directly to users of Contrax, who likely would not have used any other DeFi platform. Alongside the ARB, we are are also providing a way to stake that ARB to provide liquidity, and a way to vote with it Snapshot. In this way, our users will be given clear pathways to contribute to the liquidity and governance of the DAO.Lowering Friction for Transactions: By covering social wallet transaction costs, users who may not be able to manage gas will be participants in DeFi, and feel comfortable in joining vaults because there is one less cost and logistical barrier in their way.Contrax’s approach is not just about immediate benefits but establishing a perpetual onboarding mechanism into the DAO, ensuring long-term vitality and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Through these data-driven strategies, we aim to deliver substantial, lasting contributions to the DAO, fostering a knowledgeable, engaged, and ever-growing community.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?YesSECTION 5: Data and ReportingIs your team prepared to comply with OBL’s data requirements for the entire life of the program and three months following and then handoff to the Arbitrum DAO?

Together with his co-founder, they co-created successful MMORPG spinoffs of popular games such as Tibia and Minecraft.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?:The Beacon is already the most successful game within The Arbitrum ecosystem. We became hugely viral on late 2022 with the demo launch of our game.This image shows a few of our achievements so far with just a demo:Screenshot 2024-03-03 at 21.28.13806×1064 110 KBDuring The Settlement Launch (initial demo launch), The Beacon had a total of 21k DAU, 41% of which were retained by the end of the event.We currently have 260k total registered wallets. Our collection amounts to a total of 4 million USD  currently on the top most traded collection on Arbitrum, with more than 20k unique holders.The Beacon aims to be the game that bridges the gap between web2 and web3 games, helping our industry establish once and for all why blockchain will soon be a natural component within most games.The Beacon features an easy to understand free-to-play experience accompanied by a fun-first challenging action gameplay. This coupled with great retro style, high fidelity pixel art graphics, a highly engaging social and competitive online landscape together with a vast and very unique creative gameplay results in the blend of a game that given it’s innovative nature can compete directly even in the web2 space. It’s a game that is both fun to play and inmmensley fun to watch.The game is made for gamers. It’s a product made to appeal to the masses with its particular graphics and playstyle. It’s a game that is easy to grasp and easy to comprehend, free-to-play and portable to PC and mobile devices.As a studio our aim to be able to solve the problem of bringing web3 gaming to the masses of gamers worldwide.Please note that this application was submitted prior to a very important release of our game that will take place very soon. things are vague in order to prevent leaks, we are at this moment on The GDC in The Arbitrum Booth with a demo of our game *Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:Yes, true ownership of digital assets and the exciting possibilities of interoperability are core principles in The Beacon. We’ve actively implemented this vision by collaborating with other Arbitrum games like Bridgeworld and Kuroro Beast, where our in-game assets can be used. This fosters a fascinating interconnectedness between these distinct universes, allowing players to experience a more expansive and dynamic gaming experience. This can be extended beyond games to other other projects including defi protocols and other types of collections:Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?:There are other games within Arbitrum, however things like genre , mechanics , revenue channels and type of users vary widely and The Beacon distinguishes from them in several ways within the category, the game is very unique even for web2 standards.How do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs)As we are currently in pre-launch development and working towards our Alpha this year, our focus is on refining core gameplay mechanics and features for a successful launch. Currently we just have a Demo open. Therefore, at this stage, we are not yet formally measuring user retention. However, we have a well-defined strategy for measuring retention metrics once we enter early alpha and launch phases. These metrics will be crucial for internal monitoring and informing future development decisions:Daily Retention: We will track D1 , D7, and D30 retention rates to understand how effectively the game engages players and keeps them coming back in the short term.Long-Term Engagement: We will monitor Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU) to assess the overall health and growth of the player base over time, (although these metrics will be more meaningful upon the global launch)Monetization: We will track Total Paying Users (TPU) daily and monthly to understand how effectively the game’s monetization strategy is converting engaged players into paying users as well as TLV. One of the major indicators during this period will be our NFT mint, where we are expecting a full mint (10k + supply)We of course track relevant chain activity such asDailiy/Total volume (currently sitting at more than 2400 ETH in Total Market Volume) and contract interactions (withdraws/exports, mints, etc)However, the game is currently closed and on demo format, we will have in the following months our initiative The New Frontier Quest (more on this below) followed by a global release of the game in web3 and web2. Metrics need to adapt to the different phases of the project.Daily/Total transactions are tracked by our dune dashboard. Most of the activity of our project took place on December of 2022, where we closed the game afterwards in order to develop the features that we will release on the following monthshttps://dune.com/skillcap/the-beacon-arbitrum-ltippDo you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan:YesDid you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal? If so, please disclose the details of that arrangement here, including conflicts of interest (Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant):NoSECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSIs the protocol native to Arbitrum?: [Yes/No, and provide explanation]YesOn what other networks is the protocol deployed?:NoneWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?:Nov-23-2022Arbitrum (ETH) Blockchain ExplorerArbitrum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | ArbiscanArbitrum (ETH) detailed transaction info for txhash 0x4e984f443a0bc6736a8ffa8157a7645761df41eef961e0ff91de5f9c1965c752. The transaction status, block confirmation, gas fee, ETH, and token transfer are shown.Do you have a native token?:We do have a token initiative planned for release later this year/early next year, all the game’s success has been achieved without any token whatsoever. We will announce details on this soon, but can’t disclose within this post for now given it’s public.Past Incentivization: What liquidity mining/incentive programs, if any, have you previously run? Please share results and dashboards, as applicable?Since our proptotype launch on November 2022 we have run several campaigns with other projects to attract more members to the community and the web 3 gaming space in general.Current Incentivization: How are you currently incentivizing your protocol?:As of today we don’t have any running program to incentivize our community. Nevertheless, in the past we have done several collaborations with other projects, rewarding our commited community members with special NFTs and in game opportunities, running activities with renown projects within the ecosystem, such as Kaiju Kingz, Treasure and others.Currently we are working on a months long initiative where users will dive deep in The Beacon game as well as our Webapp. This initiative is called The New Frontier Quest (more info on the sections below)image2000×900 240 KBYou can check our twitter feed the latest marketing campaign on the buildup for this activity, where we uploaded 4 videos to announce The New Frontier quest. We are having sizable traction and a very positive reception:Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 23.18.251180×1070 107 KBhttps://twitter.com/The_Beacon_GGHave you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem related program? [yes/no, please provide any details around how the funds were allocated and any relevant results/learnings(Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant)]Yes, although since these funds are subject to project milestones across several months, we haven’t received these funds yet, and they are structured to assist toward the project’s development and G2M, ranging from open testing, to early alpha and subsequent alpha launch (global launch).Protocol Performance:More than 250k accounts registered in the gamePeak of 21k DAU during our demo launchBiggest NFT Collection in terms of total volume on Arbitrum on Openseaimage2000×892 97.7 KBWe composed 25% of total network activity during the peak days of our launchMore than 44k mints and 25k unique holders and details like the ones in the image below:image1920×2534 327 KBProtocol Roadmap will be vague given this post can be considered a “leak” and we will release announcements very soonIn short, these are the most important proximal milestones of 2024:The New Frontier Quest (Pre-Alpha that converges with LTIPP period)Global ReleaseHappy to discuss these in detail with the council**Audit History & Security Vendors: **In terms of security we plan to take all the necessary precautions in terms of auditing of our smart contracts.We currently have no bug-bounty programs, however some activities mentioned later in this form act as a bug-bounty mechanisms.Similar to how we did with our initial demo launch on Late 2022, The game is structured to be bot-resistant and secureSecurity Incidents:NoneSECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONRequested Grant Size: 200k ARBJustification for the size of the grant :We believe that 200k ARB tokens are a reasonable amount to be able to reach a wide audience of new players and cause a potential impact as a marketing tool te draw more eyes on social media, as well as serving to help create a great foundation for our Global LaunchThis amount is relatively conservative, as we intend to align these funds with the set of incentives we ourselves as a project will be running during the following months, where our own token and our own initiatives will bring the most traction.However, these funds as incentives can prove particularly useful for deeper player retention, a richer referral system, more contract interactions within our protocol, deeper fidelization of users towards the chain, as well as acting as a clear signal of support from the DAO, compelling other games to join Arbitrum. The Beacon onboarded several games to Arbitrum in the past (Kuroro Beasts, Mighty Action Heroes, Monkey Empire, etc). By being one of the flagship games of the chain, we have been of particular influence to games that are still reluctant on which chain to choose. One of our main arguments has always been that Arbitrum backs their builders in a way most other chains don’t. The LTIPP is a tangible example of this, and the impact of onboarding more games to the chain can’t be understated, yet  KPIs to measure their impact are hard to produce, as the outcomes are not immediate.Grant Matching: [Enter Amount of Matching Funds Provided - If Relevant]Grant Breakdown:Community and incentive rewards (100%): $ 200K ARBThese will be used to fund the grant token reward system within the game and the activities that will take place during The New Frontier Quest, incentivizing user activity and engagement through:Retention incentives (80%) :- Quest completion rewards- Referral bonuses- UA mechanisms that reward users trying the game for the first time- Daily login bonusesChain Incentives (20%)- Minting/import of items inside and outside the game(contract interactions on Arbitrum one)- Secondary market transaction rewards- Refunding of feesWe will evaluate distribution based on player feedback as well as council feedback, given The New Frontier Quest will last several weeks.Funding Address:0xfa2EBd5aE6fdA003376555165ffF683e87D1CcB1Funding Address Characteristics:The Address is a 2/3 Gnosis SafeTreasury Address:0xfa2EBd5aE6fdA003376555165ffF683e87D1CcB1Contract Address:TBD, likely 0xd6a6b9FC4589d690117724Df893ae8BB1A4542f1 that we use for tx fees as well as to fund project initiativesSECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESObjectives:Increase net user base of The BeaconIncrease user engagement and retention: Drive daily/Monthly active users (DAU/MAU) to ensure a vibrant community prior tu launch and beyond.Incentivize player progression: Encourage users to explore the game’s depth and mechanics by rewarding completion of quests.Creating a deeper and more compelling Referral systems to onboard new users to the game.Increase chain loyalty by subsiding fees to users while demonstrating the ease of using blockchain within games in the import/export of assets on our webappLay the perfect ground for our Global Alpha Release (web2 included) which will take place shortly after the LTIPP period, where the global release can be of substantial impact for the chain.Execution Strategy:We are scheduling to launch the Full alpha of our game, accompanied by a global web 2 release on traditional gaming platforms like Steam as well as a mobile version that will be able to be listed on the app store (similar to how Heroes of Mavia did). This Global launch is scheduled to be released proximal to Treasure Chain’s launch (late Q2-Q3).In the time between now and the Global Alpha Release we plan to ran a “Pre-Alpha” period accompanied by a a strong marketing campaign that will feature a particular NFT as well as several rewards for existing and new users.The Pre-Alpha activity is called “The New Frontier Quest” and it will take place in both, our webapp and our game. These dates will take place soon, however we won’t post them here as we intend to do a huge announcement ourselves this week. We’ll be a bit vague in order to not spoil our own announcements, and will disclose internally with the DAO if requested. The main announcement will go live during this week, and this post will be updated with all relevant information as soon as the announcement goes live.image1920×1754 179 KBThe new frontier quest is an online activity that consists of a series of nodes that are unlocked as the user progresses. Each node is a quest that can involve Social Media activity like (twitter follows) Game Activites (finish a quest or do XYZ within de game) and Blockchain activities with The Beacon’s Assets as well as other projects assets. Quests reward users in particular ways and heavily incentivize retention towards the project.The New frontier quest will const of 3 phases.Things will be rather vague to not spoil the announcements we plan to make as a project soonPhase 1 will be available to everyone, users that participate will be able to be drafted a WL spot to mint a partircular NFT.  This NFT that will grant early access to game features as well as phases 2 and 3. It will also feature a very impactful reward for the future.Phase 2 and 3 will take place after the mint, NFT holders will be prioritized but will there will also be instances for all players to try. During these phases we will release several highly awaited game features and open instances for feedback and balance, rewarding players that help us polishing the different features and game mechannics.The dates of the different phases this will take place mimic the LTIPP’s, time frames are very, very similar.More details on rewards and incentives during this phase will be posted in here after our announcement this week.Lastly we expect to launch the global release of our game shortly after the end of Phase 3.The global release will take place in both web2 and web3 (similar to heroes of mavia).Proper execution of The New Frontier Quest can prove of substantial benefit to the global release, where the grant funds can act as a catalyst to further increase traction and expectation for the full launch.Phase 1 of the New Frontier Quest will be the period during which most users will be drawn towards the chain as well as during the Global Launch of our game that will take place after The New Frontier Quest ends.This grant can come quite in handy for this particular phase, where incentives can be aligned for more users to try the game, reach wider audiences, have a deeper referral system as well as having  more incentives to deepen retention.Token Rewards: We will assign most of the grant tokens as rewards to our users that complete specific task and quest carefully determined to incentivize exploration, progression, community growth, and participation in specific activities, as well as boosting general community engagement and The Beacon’s reach. Aligning this with a compelling referral systems as well as giving players a a pleasant on-chain experience when withdrawing/importing game assets within our app. We expect the grant funds of the LTIPP to be used within the New Frontier Quest’s duration.What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric?Retention mechanisms for completing questsPlayer referralsProgression rewardsUA + retention rewards (new users that complete the main questline)On chain interactions (imports/withdrawals) and secondary market incentives.Sky is the limit here, where we can reward players in several ways depending on how much they contribute to the game and its expansion within this process. The New Frontier Quest features a built-in progression system based on points and quests are composable by us. We can align incentive towards the users that are committed, not only to the game but to other projects within Arbitrum itself if deemed useful by the DAO, we also can very quickly implement feedback in terms on reward distribution.Most of these will be quests that take place within the webapp, as well as within the game itself, the game’s natural progression mechanics will be tied to the rewards as wellSpecify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy.Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU): Daily active users within the game and the chainNew Accounts (wallets) and total accountsQuests Completed (Total and Per User): Serves as a retention metricTotal Contract Interactions within the gameTotal ReferralsTrading volumeTwitter FollowsDiscord usersHours played and dungeons completedOther retention metrics that may be relevant to evaluate the project’s health and the effective of initatives. This will be a period of constant feedbackPlease do consider these KPIs offer superficial quantitative data, however the qualitative impact of them is much harder to estimate and describe, yet much more meaningful.We are basing some of these KPIs based on our initial demo launch on late 2022, however the impact of our launch was highly more sizable than what the KPIs suggest. At the same time, it is currently hard to measure the impact of previous DAO grants we’ve seen on other similar projects that received the STIP a few months back, the impact varies highly from project to project.We were one of the relevant factors that positioned Arbitrum as a gaming chain back on December 2022, the impact of our actions was hard to measure with KPIs back then as it is now, where tons of our users didn’t know about Arbitrum’s existence, yet thanks to our game they stayed and later rotated into other projects like Defi Dapps. Several new games joined Arbitrum (deploying or moving over from other chains) given the success we had, as well as several interop opportunities that took place between us and other projects from other chains. A successful game launch usually implies on a series of reactions that are hard to measure by quantitative data alone (Pixels is a good example of this).We expect our global launch this year to be way more impactful for Arbitrum than what we achieved on 2022. The KPIs we are pointing out in here are intended to fit the program’s description, and we are tying them to the current stage of our game, yet in this exercise there are tons of data(specially qualitative data) that we might be missing in here that can be of serious benefit to Arbitrum, as it was in the past.Grant Timeline and Milestones:Please do consider these Milestones are for The New Frontier Quest. Our global launch will take place AFTER this and the LTIPP, where all milestones and KPIs in here will pale in comparison to what can be attained if the launch goes well. This time we are launching globally on web 2 and web3, where most of the previously mentioned data was attained with just a demo. A properly executed New Frontier Quest will act as the foundation for the launchMonth 1 (Late April-May) New Frontier Quest Release:Achieve growth in DAU compared to pre-launch baseline.Release phase 1 of planned in-game quests and rewardsAt least 10k new followers on TwitterAt least 5k new joins on DiscordAt least 30.000 new accountsAt least 40.000 accounts completing the main questlineMonth 2 Phase 2 of the New Frontier Quest:Mint out the entire Writ of Passage NFT (10k+ supply)Obtain at least 10.000 users out of Referral initiativesAt least 2.5k new joins on Discord and TwitterBe at least 3-5% of total network contract interactions on different days by the end of Phase 2Achieve at least 30% completion rate for core quests.Month 3 Phase 3 of the New Frontier Quest:At least 80.000 new accounts by the end of The New Frontier QuestAt least 15k DAU during public openings for player testing and competitionsAt least 2.5k new joins on Discord and TwitterAt least 1k ETH additional Trading Volume on our different collections by the end of month 3Obtain at least a total of 15.000 users out of Referral initiativesAt least 10.000 + item imports/exports by this period (these involver contract interactions)More at least 25000 attesations by this periodMonth 4 after the LTIPP:Global launch will take place after Phase 3 of The New Frontier Quest. We expect this period to lay the groundwork for the global launch, however we expect the actual launch to bring much higher traction to our game and the chain, in terms of basically all KPIs. We mention this period here given that the LTIPP might influence the success of the launch, which affects the chain directly.How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?Receiving this grant would not only fuel the growth of The Beacon but also serve as a catalyst for the continued expansion and evolution of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Our demonstrated commitment to Arbitrum, along with the tangible data and success metrics as one of the biggest gaming proyects in Arbitrum, positions us as an ideal partner in driving shared growth.We onboarded plenty of users in the past, on our demo launch on late 2022, more than 200k accounts were created, we alone composed more than 25% of the total network activity and reached more than 2M in Marketplace volume quickly becoming one of the most successful NFT collections within the chain. We were one of the relevant factors that positioned Arbitrum as a gaming chain.With the initiatives we intend to run soon, coupled by these funds we expect to achieve similar, if not higher results.Expanding the Arbitrum User Base:Direct User Acquisition: Our targeted incentive program, powered by our own initiatives + the grant funds, will create a compelling mechanism draw to attract new players to our game. These players are likely to explore the ease of use, speed, and low transaction costs Arbitrum offers, increasing the overall user base of the ecosystem. Such as they did with our original launch.Organic Growth: As our game is one of the largest within Arbitrum, this influx of new players naturally generates positive network effects. Increased user activity within our game directly contributes to the overall attractiveness and reach of the Arbitrum network.Onboarding more games: We onboarded several new games to Arbitrum with our Settlement Launch (Kuroro Beasts, Mighty Action heroes, and more) The impact of launching a good game on a chain can’t be understated, as it draws more games towards the chain, which further increases userbase (Pixels on Ronin is a good example)Increased Network Activity and Transactions:In-Game Transactions: New players will generate significant transaction volume through their gameplay. This includes in-game purchases, participation in secondary markets, and interactions with the grant token reward system – directly impacting the health of the Arbitrum network.Increased Visibility: Our incentivized marketing efforts will create a surge in visibility for our game. Since we’re a flagship project within Arbitrum, this translates into increased exposure for the ecosystem itself.These are just some indicators of many more, as our game has proven in the past that it can work as a fantastic tool to expand Arbitrum’s ecosystem primarily through gaming, where a good poriton of the users we brought into the chain have not heard about it before, yet they stayed on it given the great experience and community it fostered.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?YesSECTION 5: Data and ReportingIs your team prepared to comply with OBL’s data requirements for the entire life of the program and three months following and then handoff to the Arbitrum DAO? Are there any special requests/considerations that should be considered?YesDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread that reference your OBL dashboard?Yes, we can provide several data for both off-chain and on-chain activity for the game and the New Frontier Quest webappDoes your team agree to provide a final closeout report not later than two weeks from the ending date of your program? This report should include summaries of work completed, final cost structure, whether any funds were returned, and any lessons the grantee feels came out of this grant. Where applicable, be sure to include final estimates of acquisition costs of any users, developers, or assets onboarded to Arbitrum chains. (NOTE: No future grants from this program can be given until a closeout report is provided.)YesDoes your team acknowledge that failure to comply with any of the above requests can result in the halting of the program’s funding stream?:Yes"

If this happens, please jump forward, and the video will resume).DeckProposal:[Non-Constitutional] Research, Development, and Quality Assurance Squad by WakeUp LabsAbstractThe Research, Development, and Quality Assurance Squad by WakeUp Labs will polish, test, give feedback and deploy (many times) the new standard for decentralized sequencers for Orbit Chains helping Esspresso and Off-Chain Labs, based on their feedback and needs.This proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s vision of progressive decentralization and provides a robust framework for future implementations, ensuring a more secure, trustworthy and developed ecosystem, which will ultimately benefit the DAO, Arbitrum Foundation, and the entire Orbit Chain stack.MotivationCurrently, Orbit Chains are launched with centralized sequencers.When using a RollUp as a Service provider, the provider controls the sequencers, and there is no decentralized sequencer standard if you want to build a custom decentralized mechanism. (And as you will read below it’s quite difficult).A Decentralized sequencers mechanism is crucial to prevent downtime, bad beheavoring and ensure the integrity of any chain. This proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s vision of progressive decentralization and aims to refine the standard for the incoming decentralized sequencers.RationaleDecentralizing sequencers ensures that no single entity has the ability to misuse their power, aligning with the principle of “Can’t be bad > Don’t be bad”.Once in the GovHack event in Brussels, we considered deploying an OrbitChain using a decentralized sequencer. Setting a precedent for a new way to address this issue explained above.The goal was to create a track record that can be implemented later on Arbitrum Chain or, at the very least, establish a new method that hopefully becomes a standard for others to utilize from now on.To achieve this, there are two main possibilities:Using the current stack (Testnet) developed by Off Chain Labs + Espresso.Developing a new mechanism where several nodes/sequencers designated by a council to validate transactions, and following a standard consensus mechanism.Both mechanisms function similarly to a decentralized L1 and If both perform well, they will avoid MEV, sequencer downtime, and other issues.However, the challenges are:The Espresso solution is not yet live on the mainnet and is still in the testing process.Implementing the second option is technically difficult, broad in scope, and requires continuous collaboration with the Off Chain Labs team. Which is already exploring this idea.Based on the feedback from Off-Chain Labs, the ARB Foundation, and people from the Espresso team , we have decided to change the proposal. We realized that assigning a squad of experts would add more value to the ecosystem than simply launching a chain with this stack.Steps to ImplementKick Off the Squad: Assign a dedicated team from WakeUp Labs to work on the project.Test the Espresso Solution: Conduct thorough testing on a testnet.Establish Collaboration: Create a framework for effective collaboration with the Off Chain Labs and Espresso teams.Deploy on Testnet: Implement Orbit Chains using the Espresso + OffChain Labs decentralized sequencer stack on a testnet.Deploy on Mainnet: Roll out Orbit Chains using the same stack on the mainnet.Document the Process: Record the entire deployment process for both the testnet and mainnet.Continuous Support and QA: Provide ongoing support, quality assurance, and testing for the new systems.Code Reviews and Improvements: Conduct regular code reviews, research, and make improvements to both the source code and documentation for Espresso and Arbitrum.Monthly Updates: Communicate progress updates to the community through monthly posts on governance forums.Performance Analysis: Analyze the performance of the new mechanisms, focusing on transaction latency, transaction costs, and infrastructure costs, including the benefits for those running these chains.Deployment Guide: Prepare a step-by-step guide for deploying Orbit Chains using decentralized sequencers from Scratch.Post-Work Conclusion: Compile a final summary document evaluating the overall success of the squad.TimelineMonth 1: Establish a clear working framework, assign a dedicated team, kick off the project, set up communication channels with the DAO, Espresso, and Off-Chain Labs, start testing on the testnet, and provide feedback.Months 2-3: Deploy the first Orbit Chain on the testnet, provide QA and testing support, and document the experience.Months 4-5: Deploy the mainnet Orbit Chain, analyze performance, document findings, prepare guides, and compile a final summary document evaluating the overall success of the squad.Overall CostThe total cost for implementing this proposal is $230,000 ARB, broken down as follows:$55,000 as soon as the proposal passes Tally.$40,000 per month for 3 months.$55,000 upon the final delivery of the Summary Document evaluating the overall success of the squad.An existing multisignature wallet will be responsible for splitting the payment into the proper tranches.To cover a qualified team of three persons:A White Hat Hacker/Researcher, who participated in the Arbitrum challenge - Arbitrum BoLD | Code4rena.Sr. Architect Full Stack Developer with extensive Solidity experience.Project Owner, able to writte Technical Documentation/Content Writer.Team InformationWakeUp Labs, fostering transparency, maintains an update thread related to its collaboration with Arbitrum.

We help users discover new platforms and opportunities and earn yield, all through a focused, streamlined experience.Team Members and Roles: Redmption: Project Lead | Absolute Unit: BD Lead | Just Z: Social Lead | JasperS13: Dev Lead | Gruad: Treasury Lead | YogaFire: Community LeadProject Links: https://www.harvest.finance/ | https://docs.harvest.finance/ | https://twitter.com/harvest_finance | Harvest Finance · GitHubContact InformationPoint of Contact: ababababPoint of Contact’s TG handle: @absoluteunittTwitter: https://twitter.com/AbsoluteUknitEmail: absoluteunit@proton.meDo you acknowledge that your team will be subject to a KYC requirement?: yesSECTION 2a: Team and Product InformationTeam experience:Harvest Finance is one of the original Yield Farming protocols launched in 2020 during DeFi Summer. It continues to thrive today by collaborating with numerous projects across Ethereum and its L2s, including Arbitrum, Polygon and Base. New strategies are often first to market compared to competitors, with new farms launched on a weekly to bi-weekly cadence. Harvest and its $FARM token was also the first fully anon project/token to be listed and supported by CoinBase, and soon, a CoinBase Learn initiative will be launched to teach new users about Harvest while giving them free FARM tokens to participate in the Harvest ecosystem. Harvest also prides itself on being 100% community-managed, with all contributors to the project sourced directly from those who participate in its ecosystem. Harvest’s team also includes a variety of contributors, ranging from people who have their doctorates in Economics to full stack devs and Aerospace Engineers.In early Q2 2024, a fully revised UI will be launched, H4, which will simplify the yield farming process for all users while dramatically improving the visualization of key information points, including earning power and yield generated to date. Harvest Finance is a well-known product within the ecosystem, and its ability to weather bear markets and adapt to changing trends shows its commitment and staying power within DeFi.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?Harvest has developed a number of novel products in the Yield Aggregator space. We also pride ourselves in working in a collaborative, positive way with various protocols. We were one of the first projects to build on top of UniV3 LPs. We also developed novel strategies for Solidly-style products that help reduce token sell pressure and increase user activation for their platforms.A great example of this would be our Camelot Vaults, where farmed GRAIL isn’t just dumped into more underlying but deposited into our “fxGRAIL” vault that harvests dividends and directs incentives in the most profitable way for the user. Another great example would be our Lodestar HODL strategies. Where harvested LODE is deposited into our “fLODE” vault that performs similar actions to the fxGRAIL vault in the Lodestar ecosystem.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain:Yes, our vault tokens are ERC-4626 compliant, so they can be used in Lending Markets (and have been at different times in our existence), and with our status as a Yield Aggregator, we have to be composable.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?Yes, Yearn, Beefy, etc.How do you measure and think about retention internally? (metrics, target KPIs)CategoryRelevant MetricsGeneralAll general metrics in the OBL relevant metrics chart are relevant. These metrics include: Daily Active Users, Daily User Growth, Daily Transaction Count, Daily Protocol Fee, Daily Transaction Fees, Daily ARB expenditure & User Claims and Incentivised User List & Gini Coefficient.Yield / Yield AggregatorAll metrics for Yield in OBL relevant metrics are relevant. The metrics include the TVL of the incentivized pool, and the list of depositors. The list of depositors will contain information like LP addresses, their current liquidity in USD, time-weighted liquidity in USD, and the duration of liquidity provision.Do you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan:YesDid you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal? If so, please disclose the details of that arrangement here, including conflicts of interest (Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant):NoSECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSIs the protocol native to Arbitrum?:No, we initially deployed on Ethereum Mainnet in 2020. We launched on Arbitrum in 2023On what other networks is the protocol deployed?:Mainnet, Polygon, BaseWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?:1 March 2023Do you have a native token?:Yes - FARM token | HarvestPast Incentivization: What liquidity mining/incentive programs, if any, have you previously run? Please share results and dashboards, as applicable?We have always provided rewards to our vault users. As a fair launch token we wanted to distribute our native token to the users of our protocol.Current Incentivization: How are you currently incentivizing your protocol?In line with the emissions schedule outlined in the above doc.Have you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem-related program?NoProtocol Performance:764×365 11 KBPhoto Credit: DeFiLlamaAfter launching on Arbitrum in March of 2023, we have seen steady growth in TVL and DAU. Some of our best-performing vaults have been those we’ve collaborated closely with other Arbitrum Ecosystem participants.Below are some numbers from some of our best-performing vaults. They represent 10% of the WBTC market, 20% of the ETH market, 55% of the USDC.e market, and 27% of the USDC market on Lodestar.AssetTVL3mo ChangeAPYWBTC$1.12M+2,200%25.60%ETH$493,830+2,700%33.42%USDCe$259,380+6,100%54.08%Protocol Roadmap:We have never operated off a roadmap, but upcoming dates/milestones include:Harvest 4 is a major UX/UI revamp. Addition of new Leveraged Farm types. The addition of new strategies included but not limited to - cross-chain farming, individualized leverage farms, options-based farming, etc.Audit History & Security Vendors:We have had four audits completed by Haechi, Least Authority, Peckshield and CertiK. You can find detailed information and links to the audits themselves here - Audits | HarvestSecurity Incidents:At 02:53 UTC on Monday October 26th 2020, attackers launched an economic attack on the fUSDC and fUSDT vaults to drain a total of $24 million.At around 03:30 UTC, users in the Harvest Finance Discord began noticing significant drops in their USDT and USDC balances in the respective vaults.The Harvest dev team was immediately informed, and shortly after, All DAI, TUSD, renBTC, wBTC, and remaining USDC and USDT funds on Curve were withdrawn into the vaults pending investigation. Deposits into these pools were shortly disabled, while withdrawals were unaffected.The attacker had repeatedly exploited the effects of impermanent loss of USDC and USDT inside the Y pool on Curve.fi. They used the manipulated asset value to deposit funds into the Harvest’s vaults and obtain vault shares for a beneficial price, and later exit the vault at a regular share price generating a profit.SECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONRequested Grant Size:250,000 ARBJustification for the size of the grant 34:Harvest currently maintains a large presence on Arbitrum through collaborative efforts with Camelot, Lodestar, Pendle and Dolomite. By receiving a grant, Harvest will reward protocol depositors who use Arbitrum-based farms and enhance their earning potential while receiving all the benefits of H4, including automated compounding of the farming strategy to achieve a true APY% rate of return. Issuance of ARB rewards will be based on depositor TVL within the farm and ensuring efficiency of its distribution for longevity and support of current and new projects launching on Arbitrum. The use of an ARB grant will focus on expanding the Arbitrum ecosystem, and partnering with projects that bring unique protocols to Abitrum, as opposed to simply ejecting rewards for the sake of drawing TVL.We have also shown an ability to grow TVL from ARB rewards as shown by our TVL growth on Arbitrum during this last round of STIP rewards. We had in excess of +2,000%+ growth across multiple vaults with little to no marketing efforts outside of announcements. With an ARB grant we will be able to truly double down all of our efforts on our Arbitrum farms.Grant Matching:We will match the grant with funds from our HCF (Harvest Community Foundation) multisig, up to $400k in USD rewards. These rewards will be distributed to both iFARM stakers on Arbitrum and distributed to our vaults as outlined in the execution strategyGrant Breakdown:We will be allocating 65% of the grant towards single asset vaults with matching incentives. 35% will be allocated towards other strategy types.Funding Address:0x35C469919cAf33C24D4Ff2283057E761EaE6095aFunding Address Characteristics:This will be a  multisig that will include Redmption, Absolute Unit, Just Z, Gruad, Yogafire and Jasper.Treasury Address:Harvest Community Foundation: 0xdf5845b9fd2ccbaaea048d9d083237942378ba46Operations Wallet (Ethereum): 0xf49440c1f012d041802b25a73e5b0b9166a75c02Operations Wallet (Polygon): 0x39cc360806b385c96969ce9ff26c23476017f652Operations Wallet (Arbitrum): 0xf3d1a027e858976634f81b7c41b09a05a46eda21Operations Wallet (Base): 0x218b1afc34ebf5c73950ada6f840cee134f2dc72LP Wallet (Base): 0x97b3e5712cde7db13e939a188c8ca90db5b05131Contract Address:0x35C469919cAf33C24D4Ff2283057E761EaE6095aSECTION 4: GRANT OBJECTIVES, EXECUTION AND MILESTONESObjectives:Diversify our Strategies: Expand on our current strategy portfolio to provide more Arbitrum specific strategies.Incentive Partner Vaults: Deploy targeted incentives towards our highest value partner vaults to bring additional TVL not just to Harvest but to our partner projects, such as Lodestar, Camelot, Penpie, etc.Bring in Additonal Users: Drive user adoption through strategic incentivizes and marketing efforts to bring the most new users to our Arbitrum VaultsExecution Strategy:Incentives will be distributed first to our single asset vaults, starting with a linear amount to our six largest by TVL, we will continually adjust these to ensure we are providing the highest yield on single asset tokens across DeFi. We are targetting yields above 40% on all vaults - many of our single asset vaults are already operating above 30% APY. Especially for our WBTC vault this would be far and away the best single asset WBTC vault across DeFi -WBTC (Lodestar) - Target: 30%+ETH - Target: 35%+USDCe - Target: 50%+WBTC (Lodestar - HODL) - Target: 30%+xGRAIL - 35%+wstETH - 35%+After a 2-3 week trial period we will then begin streaming rewards to LP’s (our top 3-4 vaults) and dual token vaults. Adjusting throughout the process to ensure rewards are being given fairly. At this point we will then expand reward streaming to further single asset vaults and explore any future strategies to deploy additional incentives to.We are also planning to offer a claim option to the ARB claiming process that will offer users the ability to stake their ARB into a Harvest vault to further compound their rewards and create TVL stickiness.Grant Timeline and Milestones:Weeks 1-3: Deploy approximately 5% of incentives to our top six single asset vaults per week. And 2% of incentives to our iFARM staking pool. Where iFARM (auto compounding FARM that receives a portion of protocol revenue) will also be receiving ARB STIP rewards.Weeks 4-12: Deploy  incentives to our top LP vaults and further single asset vaults. Continually review and analyze data to ensure we are deploying incentives in the most efficient manner.How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem?Harvest has shown time and again we are capable of creating first to market and novel strategies that are both collaborative for the partner protocols and lucrative to users. Increasing yield to these strategies will help bring additional eyes and encourage further collaboration / innovation within the yield aggregation space.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?YesSECTION 5: Data and ReportingOpenBlock Labs has developed a comprehensive data and reporting checklist for tracking essential metrics across participating protocols. Teams must adhere to the specifications outlined in the provided link here: Onboarding Checklist from OBL 30.

Any details relating to past projects, recent achievements and any past experience utilizing incentives. Additionally, please provide further details on the state of your product, audience segments, and how you expect incentives to impact the product’s long-term growth and sustainability.Team experience: The core team behind Hop Protocol is Authereum Labs, which includes Chris Whinfrey, Shane Fontaine, and Miguel Mota. The Authereum labs team has extensive crypto experience, originally working for the auditing firm Level K in 2018 which audited projects like Decentraland, OpenZeppelin, dydx, and Augur. In 2019 the team decided to build a non-custodial wallet called Authereum, but after seeing gas prices surge during DeFi summer they pivoted towards building a modular blockchain infrastructure project eventually known to become Hop Protocol.What novelty or innovation does your product bring to Arbitrum?: Arbitrum and other L2 roll ups are important to the long term scalability of Ethereum, however this comes at the cost of fractionalizing the user base. Users who wish to move between rollups have to navigate waiting periods and high fees. Hop bridge allows for quick, easy, and low-cost transfers between rollups which reduces the fractionalization of the Ethereum network and provides for a better end user experience.Is your project composable with other projects on Arbitrum? If so, please explain: Bridges serve an important role in onboarding users to Arbitrum which ultimately affects how all other projects grow. Hop is one of the few bridges that supports bridging between both NOVA and Arbitrum One.Do you have any comparable protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem or other blockchains?: Bridges that support Arbitrum include Hop, Portal (Wormhole), ChainPort, cBridge, Stargate, Across V2, Synapse, Connext, and Orbiter. Of those listed, only Hop and Orbiter support Arbitrum Nova bridging. A listing of l2 bridges across all platforms can be found here.How do you measure and think about retention internally?: Hop provides a comprehensive stats dashboard on its site which can be found here. The most important KPIs for Hop Protocol are bridging volume and daily active users, as they are the driving indicator of how much value Hop is providing to the L2 ecosystem. Attracting new users is always a goal, but more importantly is making sure those same users keep using Arbitrum and Hop bridge in the future.Retaining users comes down to cost and the overall bridging experience. Hop focuses on a simple and straightforward bridging experience for all types of users regardless of technical background.Retaining liquidity providers is vital to keeping bridging costs low. Hop has historically provided HOP tokens as liquidity incentives for all our bridge pairs in order to remain competitive with other bridging projects and the larger DeFi economy.Relevant usage metrics - Please refer to the OBL relevant metrics chart 11. For your category (DEX, lending, gaming, etc) please provide a list of all respective metrics as well as all metrics in the general section: Hop is a bridge and relevant metrics from the chart include TVL, Bridging Volume and a listing of liquidity providers. Our site provides tons of metrics for the DAO to monitor and we have created a Dune dashboard specifically for the LTIPP to better track relevant metrics.Do you agree to remove team-controlled wallets from all milestone metrics AND exclude team-controlled wallets from any incentives included in your plan: YesDid you utilize a grants consultant or other third party not named as a grantee to draft this proposal? If so, please disclose the details of that arrangement here, including conflicts of interest (Note: this does NOT disqualify an applicant): NoSECTION 2b: PROTOCOL DETAILSProvide details about the Arbitrum protocol requirements relevant to the grant. This information ensures that the applicant is aligned with the technical specifications and commitments of the grant.Is the protocol native to Arbitrum?: Yes - Hop Protocol supports Arbitrum as well as 7 other L2 networks.On what other networks is the protocol deployed?: Yes - Base, Ethereum, Gnosis, Linea, Optimism, Polygon, Polygon zkEVMWhat date did you deploy on Arbitrum mainnet?: September 3, 2021 - Transaction ID: Arbitrum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | ArbiscanDo you have a native token?: Yes - HOP Token. Our token distribution info can be found here: Token Distribution | User Docs | Hop DocsPast Incentivization: What liquidity mining/incentive programs, if any, have you previously run? Please share results and dashboards, as applicable?: Hop has had a liquidity mining incentive program on Arbitrum with separate liquidity pools for ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, rETH, and Magic (Arbitrum One and Nova) and a TVL of roughly $13.1M (source). Hop has distributed 9.6 million Hop, 514 rETH and 48,000 Magic to liquidity providers on the Arbitrum blockchain.Current Incentivization: How are you currently incentivizing your protocol?: Hop plans to continue its liquidity mining incentive programs on Arbitrum with separate liquidity pools for ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, rETH, and Magic (Arbitrum One and Nova).Have you received a grant from the DAO, Foundation, or any Arbitrum ecosystem related program?: NoProtocol Performance: Compared to other bridges, Hop Protocol has helped onboard a large amount of users to Arbitrum and was the winner of the 2022 Arbitrum Odyssey bridging challenge (results can be found here). 643,900 unique wallets have used the Hop Arbitrum bridge, which represents 26.27% of Hop’s lifetime transfers (source). Of Hops nearly $5 Billion cumulative volume since inception, $1.325B of it was for the Arbitrum network (26.5%) - (source).Protocol Roadmap: Roadmap | User Docs | Hop DocsAudit History & Security Vendors: Hop has undergone multiple audits which can be found here — contracts/audits at master · hop-protocol/contracts · GitHubSecurity Incidents: NoSECTION 3: GRANT INFORMATIONDetail the requested grant size, provide an overview of the budget breakdown, specify the funding and contract addresses, and describe any matching funds if relevant.Requested Grant Size: 500,000 ARBJustification for the size of the grant 20: [Enter explanation. More details are better, including how you arrived at the required funding for individual categories of expenses covered by your grant plan]:Hop is an early Arbitrum partner and was live on day one of Arbitrum’s launch (2021). Our project has continued to be a vital project to Arbitrum as it was the most widely used bridge during the Arbitrum odyssey program.Hop was also an innovator during its airdrop by being one of the first projects to do a deep dive into collecting data to identify sybil attackers. Arbitrum then used Hop’s data for the ARB airdrop, resulting in the Arbitrum DAO potentially saving over $1 million in ARB that didn’t get disbursed to sybils.Hop continues to support Arbitrum as it grows by being one of the only bridges between Nova and Arbitrum One. Our project has a strong focus on decentralization and this grant can help Hop continue onboarding users to Arbitrum.Our team has put together a detailed formula based on historical data to justify the size of our grant request. There are three categories to base our grant request on, as follows:AMM Pool IncentivesReasoning: Increasing our liquidity mining incentives can attract liquidity providers to the platform. In turn, helping to reduce slippage on bridging transactions. The allocation will be variable and weighted towards the pools based on TVL.Target Goal: A 125% increase to the current TVL of our liquidity pools can be achieved by providing a 125% boost to the current APRs of each pool.Funding Determination: The 30 Day average TVL and APR data was taken from Defi Lama. The APR for each token was converted to a quarterly return and then given a 125% boost. The incentive - in $USD - was calculated by the weighted TVL of each pool, converted into an ARB token amount and totaled.image903×215 10.9 KB1485×357 60.1 KBGas Fee SubsidyReasoning: Subsidizing gas fees by 80% will reduce end-user costs to bridge funds to Arbitrum. An 80% fee subsidy is to prevent sybil attacks that may otherwise occur if there was a 100% gas fee subsidy. Gas fees will only be subsidized to users who are onboarding to the Arbitrum chains (from any other network), and users exiting Arbitrum One or Nova will not get subsidized.Target Goal: A 125% increase in users who bridge to the Arbitrum network. As such, we expect a 125% increase in gas fees as well.Funding Determination: A Dune Query was ran to determine the average daily gas fees between 9/1/2021 to 2/29/2024. The average daily gas fee, reduced by 80%, was multiplied by 84 days (12 weeks) to get the expected $USD gas cost of transactions over the LTIPP period. This amount was then boosted 125% to anticipate the increase in users during the LTIPP period.957×89 6.3 KBBonder Fee SubsidyReasoning: Bonders run local nodes to verify if the state transitions on the source chain are accurate and decide to “bond” the transfer by locking up 110% of the TransferSum amount as collateral to be unlocked after a 24 hour challenge period. This bonder fee will be subsidized to reduce end-user costs to bridge.Target Goal: A 125% increase in volume being bridged to the Arbitrum networks. As such, we expect a 125% increase in bonder fees.Funding Determination: A Dune Query was ran to determine the average daily bonder fees between 9/1/2021 to 2/29/2024. The average daily bonder fee was multiplied by 84 days (12 weeks) to get the expected $USD value over the LTIPP period. This amount was then boosted 125% to anticipate the increase in volume during the LTIPP period.985×132 9.57 KBData Assumptions: To assist the council in comparing our request across all other applicants, we have used the following token price amounts. These amounts are based on perceived standard price assumptions across the majority of other applicants.ETH: $3,800ARB: $2.00HOP: $0.06Grant Matching: Currently Hop has liquidity incentive programs for all its pairings. Hop may request DAO for additional matching.Grant Breakdown:31.22% of ARB tokens allocated to increasing our liquidity mining incentives in order to attract liquidity providers to the platform35.23% of ARB tokens allocated to subsidizing gas fees by 80% for users who are onboarding to the Arbitrum chains (from any other network). Users exiting Arbitrum One or Nova will not get subsidized33.56% of ARB tokens allocated to subsidizing bonder fees in order to reduce end-user costs to bridge.The Hop team agrees to return to the Arbitrum DAO any unused ARB funds once the 12 week LTIPP program is concluded.Funding Address: Arbitrum Comm Multisig: GnosisSafeProxy | Address 0x31aFFc42EE3Bf28E8E452A77677e8c592F8D5C3d | ArbiscanFunding Address Characteristics: The funding address is a 3 out of 5 Gnosis Safe Multisig.

This helps reviewers understand what the program aims to achieve and how progress will be assessed.Objectives: The primary objective is to increase the rates at which users are onboarding to Arbitrum through Hop. Our targeted goal is a 125% increase in the average amount of users bridging to Arbitrum using Hop Protocol. When met, the trickle-down effects of a growing user-base will strengthen Arbitrum’s competitive advantage within the L2 ecosystem. A related goal is to see an 125% increase to TVL within Arbitrum pools on the Hop Protocol. This will be vital to support the increased demand to bridge to Arbitrum’s network.Execution Strategy:When a user bridges funds to Arbitrum using Hop there are three fees (bundled into one fee) that are paid by the user: AMM fees, gas fees, and bonder fees. Subsidizing these combined items should significantly reduce the net cost for users to send funds to Arbitrum while simultaneously giving them a stake in the Arbitrum network since rebates / subsidies are paid in ARB tokens.$ARB will be used to enhance the liquidity mining program incentives currently in place. Only the liquidity pools for ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, rETH and Magic (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) will be subsidized. The allocation will be variable and weighted towards the pools with greater TVL. For example, if the ETH pool has 70% of the total TVL then 70% of the incentives will be allocated towards the ETH pool.Every user that onboards to Arbitrum using HOP Protocol will have 80% of their total onboarding fees refunded in $ARB. Solely subsidizing users bridging funds to Arbitrum, whether it be from Ethereum mainnet or another L2.Bonder fees will be subsidized by $ARB in order to reduce end-user costs to bridge. The bonder fee is the cost to bond at the destination chain (around $0.85) and also includes a volume fee (5 basis points for ETH therefore a $1 million transfer costs $500 in volume fees).What mechanisms within the incentive design will you implement to incentivize “stickiness” whether it be users, liquidity or some other targeted metric? [Provide relevant design and implementation details]:Our goal is to bring new and unique long-term users to the Arbitrum network while simultaneously avoiding sybil accounts that look to take short-term advantage of the incentive program.One way we are preventing this is the 80% gas fee rebate that will only be for users onboarding to the Arbitrum network. Only rebating onboarding fees should dissuade users from leaving due to a higher off-boarding fee. Also, the reason we are funding 80% of the total onboarding fees (instead of 100%) is to prevent sybil accounts from spamming the network. By paying the rebates / subsidies in ARB we can simultaneously give new users a stake in the Arbitrum, which should create an attachment to the Arbitrum network.KPIs are important to assessing stickiness. We created our Dune Dashboard so that there is public data post-LTIPP that can point to the effectiveness of incentives & subsidies provided. TVL bridged, fees spent and unique user counts can be a good retention metric to determine real users vs sybil accounts.Specify the KPIs that will be used to measure success in achieving the grant objectives and designate a source of truth for governance to use to verify accuracy. [Please also justify why these specific KPIs will indicate that the grant has met its objective. Distribution of the grant itself should not be one of the KPIs.]:A Dune Dashboard has been created to monitor specific KPIs related to the LTIPP. The dashboard includes metrics related to all three of the incentivization categories:For AMM Pool Incentives: TVL, AMM Fees & AMM LP AddressesFor Gas Fee Subsidies: Gas Spends by UsersFor Bonder Fee Subsidies: Bonder FeesIn addition to those targeted metrics, we have added a few other data points to help quantify the success on the whole. This includes Daily Transactions, Daily Active Users, Bridge Volume and Unique User countsAll the categories noted above can be run for specific date ranges, which will help us with bi-weekly reporting as well as any post-LTIPP reporting and research.In addition, our site provides tons of metrics for the DAO to monitor and for post-LTIPP research.Grant Timeline and Milestones: [Describe the timeline for the grant, including ideal milestones with respective KPIs. Include at least one milestone that shows progress en route to a final outcome. Please justify the feasibility of these milestones.]:Our 12 week LTIPP goal is to see a 125% increase in the avg amount of user bridging to Arbitrum and a 125% increase to TVL in Arbitrum pools using Hop Protocol. During the duration of the program we will monitor the KPIs noted above in order to determine the effectiveness of the grant, with the goal being an increase across all KPIs. We will provide bi-weekly updates to the DAO that include reporting on the changes to the KPIs, as well as how much funding has been used so far. Our milestones are:4 Weeks: 50% increase in relevant KPI metrics8 Weeks: 100% increase in relevant KPI metrics12 Weeks: 125% increase in relevant KPI metrics, meeting our desired goal of the LTIPPHop Protocol has seen success with a similar grant program through OP (here) and are envisioning a similar outcome for Arbitrum.Any unused ARB funds at the end of the program will be returned to Arbitrum DAO.How will receiving a grant enable you to foster growth or innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem? [Clearly explain how the inputs of your program justify the expected benefits to the DAO. Be very clear and tangible, and you must back up your claims with data]:Arbitrum’s dapp ecosystem relies on a robust and active user base to support it. However, with the fractionalization of the L2 space users can be overwhelmed and may resort to users sticking to one single chain. Especially factoring in waiting periods. Hop provides an easy, fast and low cost way to onboard users to Arbitrum. This in turn alleviates the fractionalization issue and benefits all projects on the network.The grant will help us further incentivize users onboarding to Arbitrum through Hop. This will be vital during the LTIPP as fees may deter users from trying out the other projects that are running incentive campaigns. With the ability for a user to move funds from Ethereum or another L2 to Arbitrum within minutes, this will really help Arbitrum native dapps become more accessible to the masses.Hop is also the only bridge that has applied for a grant that will give incentives to users looking to access Arbitrum NOVA. The Hop team wants to ensure the entire Arbitrum network succeeds and has been a longtime supporter of NOVA bridging as well.Finally, with our newly created Dune Dashboard and our previously referenced statistics page from our website, Hop provides two great public resources for future researching purposes. Our hope is that the data can be used by the DAO to determine the effectiveness of bridge subsidies long-term.Do you accept the funding of your grant streamed linearly for the duration of your grant proposal, and that the multisig holds the power to halt your stream?: YesSECTION 5: DATA AND REPORTINGOpenBlock Labs has developed a comprehensive data and reporting checklist for tracking essential metrics across participating protocols. Teams must adhere to the specifications outlined in the provided link here: Onboarding Checklist from OBL 16. Along with this list, please answer the following:Is your team prepared to comply with OBL’s data requirements for the entire life of the program and three months following and then handoff to the Arbitrum DAO?: YesAre there any special requests/considerations that should be considered?: NoDoes your team agree to provide bi-weekly program updates on the Arbitrum Forum thread that reference your OBL dashboard? [Please describe your strategy and capabilities for data/reporting]:Our team will provide bi-weekly updates as noted on the Bridge category of the OBL dashboard. This will include TVL, Bridging Volume and a listing of liquidity providers.We have created a Dune Dashboard to monitor specific KPIs related to the LTIPP. This includes Daily Transactions, Daily Active Users, Gas Spends by Users, Bridge Volume, AMM Fees, TVL, Bonder Fees, AMM LP Addresses, Unique User counts - all of which can be run for specific date ranges.First Offense: In the event that a project does not provide a bi-weekly update, they will be reminded by an involved party (council, advisor, or program manager).

As you can see there is a steep dropoff post the incentive period.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?During the STIP, we decided to repurpose 100k set aside for partnerships to extend out the juiced vaults for another month. We were not able to find a proper set of partners that were capable to deploy options liquidity mining given the time constraints and resource requirement from the receiving team. If we had to do it again, we would get some commitment prior to the STIP period to lock-in the partnerships. However, given the amount of new projects moving over with LTIPP, it’s doubtful we will run into that problem again.We were also able to develop some new vault types we have not deployed yet as well as a new algo strategy that a few groups are interested in utilizing that should result in some newer exotic options vaults for tokens that do not have a mature spot market yet, which we are excited to deploy soon. We started the cross protocol initiatives to move over liquidity from other chains (SOL) and soon (OP) and with more to come, however the we kind of stink at doing the cross-protocol marketing and end up releasing piecemeal, we could definitely do a better job coordinating between project teams. So if STIP Bridge does get over the line, the items addressed here are what we would course correct this time around to continue to develop our relationships with other projects across the ecosystem.VaultsDuring the STIP, the vaults had an 80% utilization rate. As you dig deeper the majors tokens of ETH and ARB were constantly at 90% utilization throughout the STIP.TradersDuring and immediately following the STIP, Premia experienced an exponential growth in volume. This was due to the combination of orderbook liquidity coming online, algorithmic traders integrating into our platform, and deep liquidity in the vaults.New Plans for STIP Bridge7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?420,000 ARB8. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]*No9. [Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?Learning from the previous period, we plan on keeping the allocation percentages largely similar. However, regarding execution, we plan to incorporate different ecosystem tools to boost engagement and reach parties outside of the de facto Options Community. Note that during the STIP, we decided to repurpose 100k set aside for Options Liquidity Mining partnerships to extend out the juiced vaults for another month, as we were not able to find a proper set of partners that were capable to deploy OLM given the time constraints and resource requirement from the receiving team. Given this, we will only incentivize Vaults and Traders this time around.The new split will focus on incentivizing foundational desired behavior. This will include incentive programs for makers & takers, vault participants, and project archetype users. The breakdown is as follows280,000 Arbitrum tokens allocated to incentivizing vault participants (6/9 as before)This will allow for more option writing. We will target 6mm in new Liquidity into the vaults140,000 Arbitrum tokens allocated to incentivize makers and takers (3/9)With the recent success of trading programs by vertex and dydx we plan to replicate a similar program. They have shown a proven path to attract new traders and increase volume in a healthy and manageable manner.Moreover these incentives will help support the soon to launch project archetype. Users will benefit directly from incentivizing takers.Additionally we will be partnering with ecosystem tooling to track engagement and reach parties outside of the de facto options Community.10. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?Safe{Wallet} – DashboardThe multi-sig is already in place and the vault contracts will be provided upon deployment.11. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?Overall, the experience was very positive and led to a lot of growth in the protocol that we believe can springboard Premia’s further usage.Regarding pain points, we did have some lessons to learn regarding allocating for partnerships, described in more detail in item 6 - and this was something on our end that we’re already prepared to correct.Juiced emissions are nice for legitimacy scoring (TVL) and vanity metrics - foundational incentivization of desired behavior is where we are starting to reap what we sowed. It all plays into the cycle; higher TVL brings more eyes and rapport, and gets you into conversationswith participants that can make time and resource investments to make your Defi protocol a success.The ultimate goal we planned on solving with STIP rewards (the cold start problem), was knocked out of the park!Future Plans for the productWe are currently working on what we call Project Archetype. It will be an AA-first defi platform (that uses Premia under the hood) aimed at growing options adoption and defi more broadly by streamlining opinionated defi experiences. It will feature a first-of-its-kind ‘price protection’ feature utilizing options and smart account wallets for smoother onboarding of new users. We are planning to have this ready during the STIP bridge period this summer, and like Premia will be Arbitrum exclusive.We are working on a portfolio margin solution. Over the past 6 months the premia team has talked to current users and potential users about the limitations and struggles in the onchain options ecosystem. The universal theme among all conversations has been the need for capital efficiency. Our goal now is to create that capital efficient system with the introduction of portfolio margin. Allowing us to solve the biggest technical and economic limitation in the onchain options ecosystem.STIP Bridge Addendum*Credit to @dk3 and @Caesar as well as Lynch from the Premia Parliament for assisting with this STIP Addendum, and to our advisor Atomist from Castle Capital."

We built a new way that will allow users to earn ARB tokens on a regular basis by completing quests and collecting points. However, the feature development took longer than expected and was later impacted by the Hedgey hack. We are working hard to re-enable the feature so that users participating in Tide campaigns can receive ARB tokens on a daily or weekly basis.[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?The previous STIP round revealed some valuable lessons. Initially, our strategy for distributing rewards was cumbersome and slow to implement. We found that contacting projects and coordinating quest campaigns on Tide, with Tide rewarding users with ARB tokens, involved extensive back-and-forth communication before each campaign launch. However, as the program progressed, we refined our approach. We introduced a series of campaigns called “Tsunami”, organized entirely by Tide on behalf of partner projects. Each campaign would require on-chain actions on Arbitrum. This streamlined process proved to be highly successful, with over 11 thousand unique participants in just one week. We collaborated with 10 major projects in the ecosystem, distributing a total of 44k ARB tokens (Join this Space on Tide).New Plans for STIP BridgeHow much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?100K ARBDo you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]N[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?We are going to use the incentive in a similar way as highlighted in section 3. We will organize a series of campaigns where multiple projects will have one campaign organized by Tide on our platform. An example of this is the Tide Tsunami campaign series. (Join this Space on Tide) . We would like to launch more series like the Tide Tsunami (two of 50k ARB distributed) with more protocols involved.We are planning to distribute the remaining tokens from the previous STIP (around 15k) together with this new STIP Addendum for completing the following:launch 2 series of Tsunami campaigns of around 40/50K ARB each with old and new partners that are building on Arbitrum.The remaining ARB will be utilized to incentivize Tide community engagement via Tide’s innovative new feature, Cycles. Cycles enable projects to periodically distribute tokens based on users’ accumulated points. This engagement tool holds significant potential benefits for projects. Benefits include better and longer engagement as users are rewarded on a daily or weekly basis. Users are therefore incentivized to use protocols more often because the only way to be eligible to earn rewards is by completing quests every day/week to collect points. Points are then translated into ERC20 rewards.Moreover, projects that use Cycles distribute the rewards more efficiently and effectively during the campaign period. This allows projects to constantly improve their campaign strategy.Tide is also working on building sybil resistant campaigns using allow lists, the integration of Gitcoin Passport and the Humanode discord role verification task. Therefore, projects on Arbitrum will benefit from our sybil resistant solutions linked to CyclesSo far the quest model is not flexible (do X get Y), Tide is making it more sophisticated combining actions with continuous rewards.Our sybil protection mechanisms also prevent bots and low quality users.Tide will utilize all remaining ARBs to reward users through Cycles. The STIP represents an opportunity for Tide to introduce a novel distribution method. Users will be able to claim daily or weekly ARB rewards from their favorite projects. Only users gaining points through quests completion and campaigns are eligible.Tide allows projects to launch campaigns and simple quests that ask users to complete social (Twitter and Discord) and on-chain tasks such as verifying swaps, liquidity providing, NFT holding, minimum balance, minimum number of transactions and more. Every task completion rewards users with points that add up on a leaderboard. Tide’s leaderboard, therefore, is now not only a gamification and competition tool but also a way to reward users that participate in campaigns and quests. All of this is possible with Cycles and this STIP addendum plays a fundamental role in allowing the testing of this feature with ARB rewards.Example of Cycle campaign tasks:Daily swap with project X on ArbitrumHold TVL on Arbitrum for n daysBridge to Arbitrum every dayDeposit on a landing protocol on ArbitrumMint NFTs on ArbitrumHold Gitcoin passpord/Humanode credentialCould you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?Grant Breakdown: Using the funds to launch acquisition and retention campaigns on TideFunding Address: arb1:0xe199d0CA24306cFA5BAee371b821fE5B1edF3456From the funding address we would send part of the funds to projects that would then distribute the funds as rewards to users.

We’d like to have some reference people that are responsible for keeping contact with companies that received the STIP and are available in case of doubts or questions.Incentive programs for web3 marketing platforms like Tide are very useful as they promote activity on projects working on Arbitrum while rewarding many participating users with small rewards. For example, the series of the Tide Tsunami campaigns was able to reward more than 11k users with chunks of 100ARB each. This was done in one week, however if the campaign would have lasted longer we believe numbers would also be higher. This spreads the ARB tokens to many users instead of just a few."

To address this issue, we propose the development of a unique mascot for the Arbitrum blockchain and the production of high-quality, mascot-themed merchandise. This initiative aims to establish a distinct and recognizable symbol for Arbitrum, enhancing its visibility and appeal both within and outside the community. By creating and marketing a mascot, we can generate a sense of unity and pride among community members, promote Arbitrum’s values and mission, and increase public awareness of the blockchain.11920×1080 504 KBAbstract We seek funding of 200.000€ ($217.625) from the Arbitrum DAO to develop and market a unique mascot for the Arbitrum blockchain, along with associated merchandise. This initiative aims to enhance brand recognition and community engagement by creating a strong, recognizable symbol representing Arbitrum’s identity and values.The mascot will be central to promoting Arbitrum’s brand, and the merchandise will serve as tangible representations of the community’s mission and values. This comprehensive project will be executed in multiple phases, including research, design, production, marketing, and distribution. By collaborating with web3 designers and community members, we aim to create a mascot that resonates with our audience and embodies the spirit of the Arbitrum blockchain.The merchandise will include high-quality items such as t-shirts and plush toys, as well as innovative NFC-tagged products that generate collectible NFTs, integrating Arbitrum into both the physical and digital realms. Specifically, we plan to launch an online store similar to Big Shot (Nouns), where we will sell these mascot-themed products. The store will accept payments via Stripe and cryptocurrencies, making it accessible and convenient for the community. Additionally, we aim to create a full size mascot costume for the character to be part of future conferences and events, ensuring everything is ready for Devcon in November.To kickstart this initiative, we will evaluate proposals from various creative studios to design the mascot, offering a budget of up to €90,000 ($97931,25). The chosen studio will be responsible for developing the mascot, marketing materials, animations, the design of the mascot costume, and merchandise, including the design for 1,000 high-quality stickers (15cm x 15cm), 200 plush toys (30cm high) with NFC tags and NFTs, and 200 high-quality t-shirts. This holistic approach ensures that the mascot and its merchandise will not only enhance the brand’s visibility but also foster a sense of unity and pride within the Arbitrum community.MotivationImplementing this AIP will strengthen the Arbitrum community’s identity, foster a sense of belonging, and increase public awareness of the Arbitrum blockchain. The mascot and associated merchandise will serve as tangible representations of the community’s values and mission. By creating a distinct and engaging mascot, we can cultivate a sense of unity and pride among members, enhancing overall community cohesion and brand loyalty.RationaleThe proposed mascot perfectly aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission by offering a recognizable and engaging symbol for various events and media. This mascot will act as a visual ambassador, embodying Arbitrum’s values and uniting the community under a common identity.High-quality merchandise, including t-shirts, plush toys, and NFC-tagged products that generate collectible NFTs, will promote the Arbitrum brand and foster a sense of pride and belonging. These items will serve as daily reminders of the community’s mission, allowing members to visibly show their support and involvement.Creating a mascot costume  for conferences and events further emphasizes our commitment to maintaining a strong, visible presence. This interactive element will enhance engagement, creating memorable experiences for both current and potential community members.Key TermsMascot: A character that symbolizes the Arbitrum blockchain and its community.Merchandise: Products featuring the mascot, including t-shirts, mugs, souvenirs, and NFC-tagged items.NFC (Near Field Communication): A technology that enables communication between devices when they are close together, used here to generate collectible NFTs.NFT: Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset.SpecificationsTechnologies:Design software (e.g., Adobe Creative Suite) for mascot and merchandise design.NFC technology to integrate NFTs with physical merchandise.Design Decisions:The mascot should be relatable and appealing to the target audience.Merchandise items will be selected based on their popularity and potential to promote the brand.Alternative Designs:Consideration of different mascot concepts and design styles.Exploration of various merchandise items and promotional strategies.Related Work:Examination of successful mascot and merchandise campaigns in other blockchain communities and industries.Steps to ImplementResearch and Ideation Collaborate with Web3 Designers: Engage with web3 designers to brainstorm and develop initial mascot concepts.

If you don’t know what KPI might be relevant for you or how to properly define them, please refer to the following document:WOOFi Earn TVLWOOFi Stake TVLMonthly swap volumeMonthly perps volumeNo. of Arbitrum-inbound cross-chain swapsIn retrospect, WOOFi’s incentive program was far more than just a win for the WOO community - it was a win for Arbitrum at large. We set out to boost the visibility of budding Arbitrum projects that were flying under the radar, and we achieved this with WOOFi’s cross-chain carousel which spotlighted 13 builders over 13 consecutive weeks. This initiative alone triggered 18,347 cross-chain swaps into the ecosystem and showcased some of the attention-starved gems innovating at Arbitrum’s application layer.We led more collaborative efforts when we teamed up with Layer3, GMX, Trader Joe, Radiant Capital, Silo Finance, and Camelot to launch WOOFi’s Quest for the Holy Grail of Arbitrum. This campaign was designed to reward users who completed the quest collection with the Holy Grail NFT, giving each holder a guaranteed share of 25,000 ARB. Originally slated to go live on March 5th, the initiative was postponed due to a WOOFi Swap pricing exploit but is still scheduled to go ahead in May.Concerning WOOFi specifically, data shows that our metrics boomed from the incentives. Not only did the TVL of WOOFi Earn Arbitrum vaults more than triple from $4.6m to $15.2m, but the staked WOO also jumped from 19m to 35.6m, with 3,300 new stakers on Arbitrum. In tandem, perps flourished as WOOFi Pro 7-day volumes more than 100xed from $13.3m in late December 2023 to $1.36B in early March. In this same period, cumulative WOOFi Pro users multiplied by more than a factor of 8 from 5,429 to 45,867.Prior to the pricing exploit in early March, WOOFi Swap also observed 24-hour all-time-highs across the board with regard to swap volume ($61.7m), swap fees ($14,381), DAU (17,951), and number of swaps (21,449). It should therefore come as no surprise that Arbitrum is now home to more WOO token holders (47,666) than any other chain, surpassing even the token’s birthplace, Ethereum (19,932).6. [Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?What we have learned is that if designed correctly, incentives can really help users, make it more frictionless to onboard new ecosystems and try out new applications. For WOOFi’s STIP program, WOOFi Earn, Pro campaigns and cross chain swap fee refund are the most effective ones, as proven by the metrics in the section 5 and 9. Therefore, we would like to increase the allocation for these categories to double down.In terms of improvements, we noticed some mechanism has room for sybil attacks. We had been finetuning the rewards distribution method to proactively prevent this. In the bridge program, we will generally tie all rewards to $ value of the transaction to further prevent sybil attacks. This will also make the incentives more efficient.New Plans for STIP Bridge7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?395,000 ARB (39.5% of the STIP backfund budget)8. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?It will mostly follow the same ways with slight improvements on the distribution based on the lesson learned to double down on the areas with the highest impact9. [Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?We propose to tweak the % of ARB allocated to each distribution category as follows:WOOFi Earn 35% (+5%)WOOFi Pro 30% (+10%)Arbitrum-inbound cross-chain swaps 25% (+10%)WOOFi Stake 10% (-5%)WOOFi Swap 0% (-10%)Quests & cross-protocol integration 0% (-10%)Justifications:WOOFi EarnThe combined TVL of WOOFi’s wBTC, ARB, ETH, and USDC.e vaults more than tripled from $4.6m to $15.2m during STIP. We see this as clear evidence that these incentives were used effectively and therefore we propose to up WOOFi Earn’s allocation by 5%. Please note: we will incentivize a new native USDC vault instead of the previous USDC.e vault which has now been deprecated.1111×400 58 KBWOOFi ProWOOFi Pro cumulative volume more than 240xed from $2.6m to $6.4b during STIP. At the same time we recorded our highest ever 7-day volume of $2.28b, saw 28-day average DAU explode from 56 to 1,258, and witnessed cumulative gross income rocket from $26k to $640k. On the back of such incredible growth, we propose to increase WOOFi Pro’s allocation by 10%.1127×385 47.1 KBArbitrum-inbound cross-chain swaps7-day fees from cross-chain swaps into Arbitrum rose steeply during STIP from $6.5k at the start, to $25.3k at its peak. This growth then naturally tapered off due to a WOOFi pricing exploit that took place on March 5th. Despite this, evidence suggests that incentives used in the leadup to the exploit were highly effective, and with the situation now resolved, we propose to boost the incentives allocated to this category by 10%.693×460 50.2 KBWOOFi StakeTotal WOO staked on Arbitrum jumped from 19m to 35.6m during STIP, with 3,300 new stakers on Arbitrum. While the growth was strong, we consider WOOFi Earn, Pro, and cross-chain swaps to have exhibited stronger growth, and so we propose to decrease the incentives allocated to this category by 5%.1120×412 31.3 KBWOOFi SwapDespite strong evidence for an uptick in Arbitrum volumes during STIP, we propose to axe incentives for this category. Of the 65k unclaimed ARB we returned to the DAO, much had been earned via swap incentives. We theorize that many users were swapping on WOOFi while unaware of the swap incentives being distributed, suggesting WOOFi Swap is able to attract users/volume without incentives.1141×412 46.8 KBQuests & cross-protocol integrationWe planned to host one large quest with Layer3, Camelot, GMX, Trader Joe, Radiant Capital, and Silo Finance but it was paused just 3 hours after launch due to the WOOFi pricing exploit. In addition, only one cross-protocol integration was achieved with Cool Wallet. We consider the progress underwhelming relative to WOOFi Earn, Pro, and cross-chain swaps and have therefore decided not to incentivize this category again.https://twitter.com/_WOOFi/status/176503094870004172710. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?Multisig to receive the incentives: 0xC8b2b7A07892644a71cc42eEC809b7A4296a715AMerkle distributor: 0x1109E03516eB25eAb2150D0b274B8D4F5F3cF549Staking ARB rewarder: 0x401ff5f78B52EDb57aB019c8988e0Be933AaABCbEarn ARB supercharger distributor: 0xdF0006994c46F4d006eCb2b5aF3e212D94df23e1Earn ETH supercharger distributor: 0xfBBfcCAE3f76AFc0979f20920b4d04d608F873bFEarn USDC supercharger distributor: 0x181d8Eb2EEff20C647073c4798111Cbd1B423A60Earn WBTC supercharger distributor: 0xA397FbA8c5C1aeF9137601C185F6AB0E9CF4366211. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?Overall we think the STIP program benefited the Arbitrum ecosystem and dApps significantly, made it the de facto general purpose L2 as a substitute of Ethereum L1. One feedback or suggestion would be instead of doing one size fit for all in the incentive program, could be more beneficial to allow more flexibility in the time period of the reward distribution. It is to avoid projects trying to catch the deadline and distributing all rewards for the sake of it. WOOFi has returned some unallocated ARB tokens to the Arbitrum DAO. Allowing dApps to design the most effective way for themselves and judging by the result might be a more effective approach, it also avoids unnecessary sell pressure for the ARB token."

The system will be powered by LLM-generated summaries based on publicly available data, ensuring timely implementation before the upcoming ‘redelegation week’.MotivationEnsuring the community is well-informed about delegates’ actions and stances is crucial for transparent and accountable governance. This system will empower community members to make better-informed decisions and enhance trust within the Arbitrum DAO. With the ‘redelegation week’ approaching, the need for such a system is even more critical, as it will help community members make informed decisions about their delegates during this pivotal event.RationaleThe proposed system aligns with Arbitrum’s mission and values by promoting transparency, accountability, and user-focused governance. It ensures that delegates’ actions are visible to the community, fostering a more inclusive and participatory environment. By providing detailed insights into delegates’ voting behavior and potential conflicts of interest, the system helps maintain the integrity of the governance process, supporting the long-term sustainability and security of the Arbitrum ecosystem.Key TermsLLM: Large Language Model, a type of AI that processes and generates human-like text.Delegate: A member of the Arbitrum community with voting power to influence proposals.Voting Trends: Patterns or tendencies in how a delegate votes on different types of proposals.Conflict of Interest: Situations where a delegate’s decisions could be influenced by personal gain or affiliations.SpecificationsPlatform: The system will be built using x23.ai’s infrastructure, leveraging data aggregation, multiple LLMs for data parsing, and presenting results via a web and conversational interface.Technology Stack: The platform will use Typescript throughout the entire stack, Node.js for backend, React and TailwindCSS for the web interface, and various foundational models for LLM capabilities.Data Sources: Public forum posts, voting behaviour, delegate statements, and other relevant public data.Alternatives Considered: Manual tracking and reporting of delegate actions were considered but deemed inefficient and prone to bias.Steps to ImplementTo meet the deadline for ‘redelegation week’, this project will be a highly focused and intense build, ensuring readiness at the start of the event.Data Aggregation (3 days): Collect and organize public voting data and delegate statements.Resources: 3 data engineers, $5,000.LLM Integration (4 days): Implement and train LLMs to generate summaries and insights.Resources: 2 AI specialists, $15,000.Interface Development (5 days): Develop and deploy the web and conversational interfaces.Resources: 2 frontend developers, $20,000.Testing and Refinement (2 days): Conduct thorough testing and refine the system based on feedback.Resources: 2 QA testers, $10,000.TimelineStart Date: July 8, 2024Data Aggregation: July 8 - July 10, 2024LLM Integration: July 11 - July 14, 2024Interface Development: July 15 - July 19, 2024Testing and Refinement: July 20 - July 21, 2024Completion Date: July 21, 2024Overall CostTotal Cost: $50,000Data Aggregation: $5,000LLM Integration: $15,000Interface Development: $20,000Testing and Refinement: $10,000This proposal aims to bring a new level of transparency and accountability to the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that community members are well-informed about the actions and motivations of their delegates, in time for the upcoming ‘redelegation week’.

To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook’s small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A collective intelligence exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys, and a collective intelligence algorithm, ensuring initiatives are well-aligned with the DAO’s current needs.The pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO’s operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.The Problem:The DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.Areas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.Proposed Solution:A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problemsA funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.Questbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.Additionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.What will be funded:Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and govPriority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 20 delegates.Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote.Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).** How are proposals assessed:**An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.Fund governance:This track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program (link), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.Method to Identify problem areas:Before opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO’s research team.Based on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We’ll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 20 delegates.The statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.The ranked statements as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other) will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)Timeline:The Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.Month 1 for identifying problem areas.Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.Month 5 for reportingmonth 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbookWhat does success look like?Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.KPIs:40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent fundingOver 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilotBudgetScreenshot 2024-07-07 at 01.14.571414×632 73.5 KBNote:this proposal was originally published 9 days ago, then moved to the govhack category.

They need fast micro-loans, but the market is dominated by loan sharks with insanely high interest rates, which are impossible to pay out, leaving them in a vicious cycle.Challenges in accessing financing, along with bureaucracy, are other obstacles that Latin American micro-businesses must overcome to consolidate their growth. Financial institutions do not facilitate sufficiently the access to loans that micro-businesses need to expand their businesses. On the other hand, in general, the process of creating a company is slow, requiring numerous, complex, and costly procedures that delay starting a business.DeCredit Score gives local businesses in Latam access to micro-loans, with affordable interest rates, avoiding loan sharks, while protecting investors’ funding and providing them a good risk-managed return on investment.MotivationMicro-businesses make up 90% of all economic units in Latin America, and the majority of them depend on micro-loans. The market is dominated by loan sharks, landing micro-credits but at the same time imposing insanely high interest rates (up to 400% a year!). Besides the financial aspect, which creates a strong dependence on micro-loans they can never pay out, there is an alarming underlying security threat for the borrowers and their loved ones. Regular kidnappings or death threats by the hand of loan sharks, followed by a ransom that will be borrowed directly from the same borrowers, creating an infinite loop of debt, are a daily occurrence.Micro businesses live in a poverty trap and DeFi can drop these interest rates by about 90%. Studies have shown that access to affordable credit allows micro businesses to grow about 54% a year! We could be unlocking the potential of underdeveloped countries with a solution that allows unsecured credits to leverage the power of web3RationaleReal-world assets (RWAs) are underrepresented in Arbitrum, comprising only 1.1% of grants in 2023, and tokenized private credit making up just 0.4% of the global market. Arbitrum should develop an actionable strategy, allocate more resources, and take a leading role in RWAs, aligning with its position of being the Home of DeFi.DeCredit Score has the potential to become a tangible use case that brings an Arbitrum based blockchain solution to the masses, attracting thousands of users through word of mouth from trusted contacts and first-hand experience rather than blockchain insiders. By addressing the problem of loan accessibility for micro-businesses, which represent 90% of Latin America’s economic entities, DeCredit Score and Arbitrum will provide tangible value to DeFi and gain significant public traction.How Does DeCredit Score Work?Frame 261920×556 41.5 KBThe micro-business owner (user) registers on the app, creating a smart wallet and getting onboarded to Arbitrum. The user, then, undergoes a KYC process that has two parts: in-app validation of business location, identity, and business permits, followed by on-ground validation by DeCredit Score team members with attestations. This process assigns an initial credit score.Next, users create profiles and can add validations (e.g., email, social media, crypto transactions via Bitso, house ownership (through the Ethereum Attestation Service), and payment history) to boost their credit score. Users then can apply for loans, specifying the amount, weekly payments, and justifications (such as business invoices). DeCredit Score doesn’t require collateral initially; instead, each weekly loan payment builds collateral, mitigating risk if payments stop.The pilot, with a 200k stablecoin loan pool on ARB, aims to support 100 micro-businesses over six months. Past research* shows micro-businesses often renegotiate loan terms due to vulnerabilities to unexpected events, not lack of commitment. DeCredit Score offers flexible payback terms.Pilot KPIs include:Number of businesses signed upInitial and final credit scoreNumber of loans paid on timeNumber of renegotiated loansTo prevent gaming the system, the app uses dID to recognize if users try to open multiple accounts, ensuring the same credit score and verification stamps apply, and blocking new loans if previous ones aren’t repaid.*NOTE: DeCredit Score’s database is sourced from a Mexican financial institution that serves micro-businesses.

The accelerator will launch 5-10 new bespoke high-quality meme coin projects in 6 months. These fair-launch projects are required to use ARB as currency to purchase meme coins and to use ARB in AMM liquidity pools.MotivationCurrently, the ARB token has no other utility besides the governance function in the Arbitrum DAO. Clearly, more utilities created for ARB token will add lots of value to the Arbitrum community, which are illustrated in the most recent proposals: ARB Staking and Timeboost.The invisible hand behind Solana’s huge success in meme coin is the economic engine where SOL is being used to purchase meme coins and being used/locked in the AMM LP pools - a new utility for SOL. It creates a virtuous cycle: meme coins generate new demands for SOL, which drives up the SOL price, which creates value to SOL holders who then deploy the profit back to meme coins.Arbitrum now has the infrastructure ready to replicate the SOL playbook, and by doing so, it will create a new utility for the ARB token, increase Aribitrum’s TVL, and supply new assets for Arbitrum’s DeFi. And to execute the vision, we need a catalyst. A meme coin accelerator is the catalyst to showcase the new utility of ARB and to start the flying wheel of the ARB economic virtuous cycle.RationaleThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum Community Value by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure. In addition, supporting meme coins makes Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive.SpecificationsMeme coin projects are required to use ARB to purchase meme coins, especially any pre-sale, and use/lock ARB in the AMM LP pools.Meme coin creators will only need to focus on community, social & marketing, and the accelerator will do the common work for these projects:Product & engineering work on both smart contracts and front-end (done by Double)Liquidity support via Double and incentive distribution to capital providers (done by Double)BD with Arbitrum ecosystem projects especially DeFi projects (done by accelerator managers)Steps to ImplementIf the Arbitrum DAO approves the proposal, thenSearching and recruiting meme coin creators on a rolling basis.Design and develop the smart contracts and front-end products, and customize them for each projectLaunch meme coins on a rolling basis.Incentivize liquidity providing for each meme coin.Conduct BD with Arbitrum ecosystem projects especially DeFi projects.TimelineAfter getting on-chain approval and funding, complete the program in 6 months.Overall CostThe proposal requests total funding of $610k in ARB from Arbitrum DAO, which will be used to fund:#1: $270k on product & engineering. 3 FTE@$15k/month for 6 months - 1 FTE on smart contract, 1 FTE on front-end, 1⁄2 FTE on designer, 1⁄2 FTE on product management.#2: $250k to incentivize liquidity providing for meme coins.#3: $90k for accelerator program management: 3 managers@$5k/month for 6 months.Deck link:https://tome.app/vennity/memechain-copy-clyac13ot0vwqbvf1liaz1h6q"
