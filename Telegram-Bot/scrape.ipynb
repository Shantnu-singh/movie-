      "TL;DR.WakeUp Labs is developing a ZK Identity Toolkit for developers building on the Superchain, prioritizing self-sovereign identity and privacy. This toolkit, focuses on simplifying identity-related features using cutting-edge zero-knowledge (ZK) technology.Flyer 1 missions OP zk1200×627 25.7 KBWhat are we developing?Our proposal centers on building a toolkit based on zero-knowledge technology, designed to integrate effortlessly with the Superchain. This toolkit enables developers to incorporate ZK proofs into their decentralized applications (dApps), allowing for enhanced security and trust between users and applications. By doing so, we aim to give individuals full control over their identities and privacy.If you’d like to learn more about the roadmap, check out our previous entry for this mission!
